downtown weekend
The posers own all the clubs downtown
Without their help we can still get around
Their new wave nights at the discotheque
And they rip you off for five bucks a head
We don’t care what they say
Only morons go there anyway
Listen to the cars and the knack
Van halen zeppelin all that crap
Let’s go downtown, golly, oh wow
Have lots of fun, I wonder how
Let’s go downtown, golly, oh wow
Have lots of fun, I wonder how
We’re always kicked out of all the clubs
Getting the hassle from the cops
Into the paddy wagon you and you
Who the fuck are you talking to
So we end up hanging about
Waiting for the bus to take us out
And we catch the last one for the night
Full of rockers looking for fights
Let’s go downtown, golly, oh wow
Have lots of fun, I wonder how
Let’s go downtown, golly, oh wow
Let’s go downtown, golly, oh wow
Have lots of fun, I wonder how
Let’s go downtown, golly, oh wow
When you get home there’s nowhere to hide
You’re in shit when you walk inside
Your old man beats you half to death
For having fucking beer on your breath
Another boring week ahead
Getting up early kills my head
So that’s it for our weekend
I can’t wait to do it again
Let’s go downtown, golly, oh wow
Have lots of fun, I wonder how
Let’s go downtown, golly, oh wow
