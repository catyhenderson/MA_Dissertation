 Stupid Songs 
When I sing songs I sing about what I know But I don't know too much so I don't sing about nothing I get my words from reading TV Guide I steal all my solos from the Rolling Stones  I like stupid songs  I get my insight from watching Spiderman I learned a lot from Peter Parker about dealing with the world I pull my wire to the 20 Minute Workout I sure wish the guys in the band looked like that  I like stupid songs

 Argh Fuck Kill 
Bla bla bla bla Bla bla bla bla, etc. Argh...Fuck...Kill

 Die Sinner Die 
You have sinned so you must die Die sinner die You will bring on the red tide Die sinner die Jerry Falwell's god says that war is good At least that's what they tell us and christians never lie  You will hang in the park Die sinner die God's army will leave its mark Die sinner die We'll burn the fire of communism by lighting you on fire And then we'll roast jelly beans on the funeral pyre

 Bedtime Story 
Flesh and blood and splattered guts Dripping brains and radiation Everybody's mutilated Screaming missiles and burning babies  This is just a bedtime story to help you through the night Cause when you wake up tomorrow morning you're gonna have to fight

 My Girl 
Oh my girl she's a bit homely She's got a few fleas and a touch of the mange In fact she's so oh oh oh oh so god damn ugly yeah ugly, oh she’s ugly, woah ugly Oh my girl she's got a big sticky tongue Four hairy legs and a big smelly cunt Her name is oh oh oh oh her name is  Lassie yeah lassie, woah lassie lassie come home
Oh my girl like we said she’s a dog
But don’t try to put me down
Until you try her out
Oh my girl


 Dogfarts 
One day when I was home alone Just me and the dog holding the phone I gave my pal a piece of cheese It was limberger the cheese that pleezes  Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh he had to go Oo oo oo oo oo oo oo Number two Ar ar ar ar ar ar ar it was to far Or or or or or or or to the door  There was shit and piss all over the place My dog Wallace had gone to pieces There was a revolting oder in the air It was limberger the cheese that pleezes

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh he had to go ee ee ee ee ee ee ee Number three Ar ar ar ar ar ar ar it was to far Or or or or or or or to the door

Dog farts Dog farts Dog farts Dog farts Dog farts

 Inside My Head 
I don't think you understand Just where the fuck we're coming from You think that the world is bland And we're here to relieve the monotony  I don't care what you think you can't see inside my head   I tell you to pound you pud I tell you to kill your mother I tell you to rape your dog You might as well, you'll get no other

I don't care what you say you can't see inside my brain
I don't care what you think you can't see inside my head
I don't care what you say you can't see inside my brain

 Stupid World 
Lisa washed her hair on Monday Lisa washed her hair on Tuesday Lisa washed her hair on Wednesday Lisa washed her hair in Thursday  Then her husband noticed that her shampoo Had upset her pH balance Her hair was all dried out and frizzy So he shot the bitch and moved to the city

Oh what a stupid world  Her husband got a job at a roller rink He tried to pick up chicks but he had a little dink He brushed his teeth with Aim but it didn't matter Nice fresh breath but his dink didn't get no bigger  Oh what a stupid world
Oh what a stupid world

 Fuck My Shit Stinks 
Sittin on the pot on Tuesday morning Reading about the war in Lebanon A car bomb killed three yankees in Rome But I got a bigger problem and its closer to home  Oh fuck my shit stinks Holy fucking moly my shit stinks Argh fuck billy my shit stinks  Maybe there's something wrong with my diet I had a case of beer and couple of tacos You know I feel like Johnny Cash Going down in that ring of burning fire

Oh fuck my shit stinks Holy fucking moly my shit stinks Argh fuck billy my shit stinks  Well all my friends like heavy metal But I've always been partial to polkas While they're all playin their air guitars I'm fartin along with the booming tubas

Oh fuck my shit stinks Holy fucking moly my shit stinks Argh fuck billy my shit stinks

 Fuck Satan To Death 
Jesus is my savior and satan must die This is the end ready for death Reaper is near pity the damned Lucifer's lust has got out of hand Let's fuck him up by fucking his ass Rear out his tail pull out his horns Send the fucker where he belongs Send the mother back to his hole Let's take him out and slip him the pole It's easier said than easier done The battle's over and we have won Snuff out his life and have the last laugh 'Cause we've got jesus here in the band


 Dragons 
You created your character But your destiny is ruled by the die of six You're standing at the edge of churning black water A tributary of the river Styx I am the master of this world I could have the earth devour you where you stand You exist for my pleasure You'll soon wish you never stepped into my dungeon Clutching hands grab at your legs They pull you down underground You draw your sword, recoil in horror The serpent's venom takes its toll I am the master of this world I'll have my fun with you One by one your lives are coming to an end
Look around at all the world

I am the master of this world
I could have the earth devour you where you stand You exist for my pleasure You'll soon wish you never stepped into my dungeon
 You're the last alive and you've lost your nerve You turn and run you might survive You need a way to leave this plain You'll lose your soul if you remain You see a door no time to lose Kick it down and run right through You step into a glowing cavern Suddenly you hear a voice I am the master of this world You're all fools if you think you can escape You're in this 'til the end Look around see what you have to fight Dragons


 Hide The Hamster 
Well Billy was a boy who has a few ideas of his own He has a habitrail maze with 35 hamsters in his home He takes them to the disco where everybody loves him They cover them with neet and wash them down so they are nice and clean Then yank their teeth and pull their claws and dip the little rodents in vaseline They all have habitrail tubes stuck firmly up their asses  And they all sing oho oho hide the hamster
oho oho hide the hamster  They dance around on the dance floor From each shaking ass hangs a twitching little tail The hamsters last about five minutes And their death throws bring the dancers close to ecstasy They shoot their wads together dead hamsters up their asses  And they all sing hide the hide the hide the hamster
hide the hide the hide the hamster  They all have habitrail tubes stuck firmly up their asses Each hamster has an orgasm at the very instant of its death So each person grabs a straw to feltch their partner's asshole of the sperm They'll suck their straws together and swallow rodent semen  And they all sing hide the hide the hide the hamster
hide the hide the hide the hamster
hide the hide the hide the hamster

 Drugged And Driving 
It was a quarter to twelve and we were rocking I put my money on the bar, I heard the devil knocking We played some drinking games while the band was thrashing And a fight broke out so we gave the place a trashing When the cops showed up I had to eat all my drugs A couple of the guys got the kiss their billy clubs The rest of us got out through the basement door I ran to the back and i dove into my car  I was drugged Drugged and driving
I was drugged Drugged and driving  We got away clean but I was feeling kind of strange I just ate 25 speeders I could feel the adrenaline pumping through my veins like a burning fire straight to my brain and then to the tires of the car I was driving at sixty miles an hour I stepped on the gas and went with the power screaming like an angel of the devil my friends are in the back and we're headed straight for hell 
We were drugged
Drugged and driving
We were drugged
Drugged and driving
 if you're on our roads you better keep on your toes 'cause we're gonna get you into our sights we're gonna track you down 'cause we're the demons of the underground caverns of lucifer and when we get you under our hooves we'll trample you into the dirt and tear your soul from your broken carcass and deliver it unto our lord

 Here Today, Guano Tomorrow 
Bill and Tammy Bakker were messengers of God and the Bank of America Tammy sprays on her makeup, pops some downers and says this must be heaven Jim is in the bedroom converting hookers on a mattress full of money Meanwhile another 1000 people make their beds with death and misery and starvation  They were here Here for today But they'll be guano Guano tomorrow  Now it's Reverend Fallwell's church and he has the need for a little more money It will cost a lot to eliminate rock and stamp out the international threat of communism Mister Reagan and Gorbachev will let us fight like animals in a barnyard While they play the roles of the farmer the butcher, the distributor, and the consumer

They were here Here for today But they'll be guano Guano tomorrow
They were here Here for today But they'll be guano Guano tomorrow

It doesn't matter I've got a library I've got a swimming pool I drive the Lamborghini Dad drives the Cadillac Mom's got an MG I don't have a job I don't go to school I just sit at home I don't have to worry They got lots of money They won't let me starve In 1967 things weren't this good My daddy was a hippie Now he's a head of state I don't have no peers I don't know no queers It doesn't bother me I don't get in fights When I go out at night Coz my chauffeur is a killer I don't have to look When i want a fuck I just spend some money I get more allowance Than you fucking middle Class bums will ever see
In 1967 things weren't this good My daddy was a hippie Now he's a head of state in 1967

Wanna be dead before the day is through

Black sabbath

Acting like black sabbath is lots of fun Their records sound so heavy when I turn them on I jump up and down and pretend I'm them I can almost make the change 
Acting like black sabbath
Acting like black sabbath
Acting like black sabbath
 Tony iommi is my god His guitar solos have been ostracized  Ozzy Osbourne is so out in space That he'd probably love me if I pissed on his face

Acting like black sabbath

Acting like black sabbath
No no no



Used to be in love

I used to be in love with the world Until I listened to the leaders words I used to hang around with the guys When they told me to split I fucking near died  I used to be in love I used to be in love

I couldn't stand their attitude for another day They were trying to synchronize me so I blew them away My daddy was a bitch he screwed around with my dog and cat My mommy satisfied her thirst with a bag of urine  I kinda liked my sisters friends Keep em fresh in the fridge Murdered the bitch with a baseball bat She was only five wadda ya think of that  I knocked her down the basement stairs Then I burned off all her hair Mutilated her virgin body My mommy caught me and she tried to stop me  I killed mommy with my automatic

The Prisoner

Apartment walls, halls are small
Government building site much too small
These tiny boxes won't let me out
These tiny boxes are too remote

It's a screaming mess
Television city dream
Your robot's eyes gleam
In my future dream

Yeah hey!
It's not fate or chance
It's the money in the bank
Burn their timber and gather their bricks

Drive 'em into the fire, the bloody dicks
It's a screaming mess
And I am the prisoner
The prisoner, the prisoner

Go!
It's not fate or chance
Kick somebody in the face
Burn their timber and gather their bricks

Drive 'em into the fire, the bloody dicks
It's a screaming mess
Television city dream
Your robot's eyes gleam

In my future dream
And I am the prisoner
The prisoner, the prisoner
Well I am the prisoner

The prisoner, the prisoner

You got your money, you got your car You got your bottle at the bar It doesn't mean that, you're anything A rich bitch, a rich bitch The public loves you, you're gonna go far Cause you're throwing a charity bazaar It doesn't mean that you give a damn Watcha? You're nothin but a rich bitch A rich bitch, a rich bitch You expect me to spend my time Loving you and pouring you wine You just might as well forget it I'm not your slave A rich bitch, a rich bitch The public loves you, you're gonna go far Cos the society makes you what you are But that doesn't mean you're ready to be Whatcha? You're lying in the ditch, bitch ? You're gonna go,? You're gonna go,? You're gonna go,? Bitch!

[Chorus:] a season in hell. well, most things get tougher everyday but I know, it's got to be that way. 'cause cattle have blockers on their heads and quartz dogs fire in their eyes. [Chorus] sitting home in an empty room air seems thick as an ancient tomb little ears seem to grow from ceilings and walls. need no keeper to know the score grisly faces peer through your door. could it be time to cast these demons aside.

The Warrior Ain’t No More
Into the badlands, the white man came Killing out of fear, what they couldn't explain Disease unknown to this virgin land Laid to waste, with the gun in command From the steel rails, and the blood of the kill Burning carcasses, with a gleam in their eye The sheer sport, and the blood of the kill Burning carcasses, till they had their fill The warrior ain't no more The warrior lost his war, the white man came and left his pain Now the warrior ain't no more The pain and the sorrow rose with the sun, ending their dreams with a whip and a gun Taken their rights and their dignity too Bound to be slaves, ready for abuse To the reservations, by government sent Fill up the prisons, till they repent Now the land, that's all that's left will be taken back, with another theft

No Way Out
The line was made from the left to the right, what was left in the middle was nowhere in sight You've had your chances, you've had your time Don't waste the rest, get in line Nobody knows, nobody cares that the world's going nowhere Nobody knows, nobody cares, that we're all going nowhere There's no way out The part's for you, it'll fit in nicely, one size fits, all precisely Now you're a man, a man for all ages any size fits all cages

Trial by Media
Media, paints a picture for the people who need it Not somebody who's breathing but somebody who's different It takes brains, looks or weirdoes See them on the TV Taking life in their own hands trying to live their own life not kissing someone's ass Marching in time to the modern sound what you imagine, keeps coming down Day by day, week by week Where is the energy we all seek we've got the future in the palm of our hands Still we wait on somebody's command But if you try to change the day, you'll just get locked away They'll just put ya... Under trial, it's a trial by media Trial by media Under trial, it's a trial by media They locked the five away - an' threw away the key An' now they world is safe - for them an' you and me But everybody knows - it's really not that way Where are the lies coming from anyway?

America the Beautiful
Lock your doors, lock it tight It's the new immoral right They wanna cleanse the home of the brave For the master race of the U.S.A It's so beautiful on the street You won't know them Like a pack of wolves In sheeps clothing, spreading wide Spreading far not just another false alarm It's so beautiful America I got my bible America I got my handgun America Now I'm ready America Home of the brave America And the home of the slaves America Now I'm ready but are you?

downtown weekend
The posers own all the clubs downtown
Without their help we can still get around
Their new wave nights at the discotheque
And they rip you off for five bucks a head
We don’t care what they say
Only morons go there anyway
Listen to the cars and the knack
Van halen zeppelin all that crap
Let’s go downtown, golly, oh wow
Have lots of fun, I wonder how
Let’s go downtown, golly, oh wow
Have lots of fun, I wonder how
We’re always kicked out of all the clubs
Getting the hassle from the cops
Into the paddy wagon you and you
Who the fuck are you talking to
So we end up hanging about
Waiting for the bus to take us out
And we catch the last one for the night
Full of rockers looking for fights
Let’s go downtown, golly, oh wow
Have lots of fun, I wonder how
Let’s go downtown, golly, oh wow
Let’s go downtown, golly, oh wow
Have lots of fun, I wonder how
Let’s go downtown, golly, oh wow
When you get home there’s nowhere to hide
You’re in shit when you walk inside
Your old man beats you half to death
For having fucking beer on your breath
Another boring week ahead
Getting up early kills my head
So that’s it for our weekend
I can’t wait to do it again
Let’s go downtown, golly, oh wow
Have lots of fun, I wonder how
Let’s go downtown, golly, oh wow


  LOOK, HERE COME THE WORMIES
From deep and dark and dirty  Come creeping, crawling, squirming menace, threat  To frighten the world socialistic coelomate  Segmentated separatist they're tunnelling holes in our home. 
Look here come the wormies  Look here come the wormies  Look here come the wormies  They're going to take us all take us away 
Sitting in your duplex home talking on the telephone  Hungry wormies are very near  Anarchaic annelid oligochaeta  Revolt overthrow and be overthrown 
chorus 
Now we've settled down again  But the time is coming when wormies will be taking us away


Living is free
You’ve had your dreams come true Made him into something new Now there’s no turning back You’ve heard the pistol crack
Living is free, free and at ease
You’ve seen what you can do More than you ever know All ways are one to you There’s nothing left to lose
Dig nothing Piles of bodies lie inside a hole Dig nothing
You’ve had your tubes replaced There’s grime smeard on your face Your hands are stained with grease For you there is no peace
Living is Friction, damage, freedom, pleasure Piles of shit and hidden treasure Pay the price Living is free
My roommate is turning into a monster
He just sits and watches T.V. He doesn’t look at me, he’s always watching me He says the free life is best Why don’t you clean up the mess? There’s something wrong  with him All his masks are caving in
He doesn’t go out much no more His clothes are pled neatl on the floor He hasn’t shaved in three weeks He hasen’t even brushed his teath This is not whta i meant I just wanted to share the rent
His eyes are closed but he never sleeps He’s breathing, he’s breathing deep He’s got something on his mind He can’t seem to unwind He said,
Don’t you fuck nobody else Don’t you fuck nobody else
What’s this? I don’t have any tits You can’t treat me like this, I don’t have any tits
He’s sold the car, he’s locked the door He says that he don’t care no more He’s drawnn the shade, he’s shut the binds I think that he has lost his mind I can’t believe what i see He’s rising his hand Against me Myroommate is turning into a monster He’s a beast
Mama’s little boy
Come the night, come the night All the man want to fuss and tight But not me, not me `Cause that’s not what i want to be Cause I’m Mama’s little boy
Mam tells me everything she sees Well it may scare you but it don’t scare me Cause I’m Mama’s little boy I like what i want to see
All day long she watches her dancing sons Come the night she picks the talles one But I’m Mama’s little boy I’ve nothing to hide
All the Gods, the Gods of the sun They’re just bastards sons Daddy, Daddy, come and see The onslaught of insanity Cause I’m Mama’s little boy And I’m mad
There’s a place where I want to be And it’s dark there, there’s nothing to see And you’re alone, there’s nothing you can do Something’s coming, something’s coming to you You are- you don’t know where you are You are- you don’t know who you are You are—you don’t know what you are You ae helpless, you are helpless That’s where I want to be, there’s where I want to be Cause I’m Mama’s little boy I feel, I can feel Joy
Red Devil
Red devil bites your neck Your tongue’s stiking out, your cock is erect You’ve run out of screams, you’ve scattered the deck Red Devil
Blue eyed creep, dig your hands in deep Red Devils squawks like a night bird in the jungle heat In warm water my tongue creeps But don’t make too much noise, cause the monster’s asleep
Your cock is erect, your tongue’s sticking out You’re shaken and taken and cast all about Red Devil
You’re burning, you’re burning Flame and steam, the blush of lust Red Devil
Blue eyed creep, dig your hands in deep Crawl in, crawl in, crawl in deep Your dreams are wet and then you forget The monster’s asleep
Fog and night, endless fight I rise from the muck a Prince of Cups Tou shhalt not kill, this is my will Rise up and kill, this is my will Red Devil
Up from the muck, my tongue’s in the cup Rise up and kill, this is my will This is my will, rise up and kill  
We are the chopped
We are the chopped, the chopped The lecer drops and stops This is not good or bad Transformers hum and pop The little dials they drop No reason to be sad
It’s only to be still with one more role to fill The widow stands inline, the loved one’s killing time Cause when you’ve stopped, you’ve stopped It’s either now or not No viction and no crime
As you wander through your days, you leave the Moments lying cold and underpaid, your savings plans are sound They’ll do somebody good when you are underground
This is not good or bad No reason to be sad No viction and no crime Cause when you’ve stopped, you’ve stopped The ball is thrown and caught It’s just the end of time
The mourners ring the bells and shed tears for themselves It was really unkind to leave us all behind We are the chopped, the chopped But you’ve not said alot There’s nothing to find
You make patterns with your eyes and blacken in The details you don’t recognize, you say that life is breath and when The breathing stops you turn mutter Death
We are the chopped, the chopped But you’ve said a lot This not good or bad No reason to be sad We are the chopped, the chopped And when the pressure drops You simply stop, you stop You stop You’re dead
No Sex
It’s the holy trinity, Mom and Dad and little me It’s the holy trinity, Mom and Dad, Mom and Dad, Mommy What you are is what you see What you are is just a little funny You’re somebody’s fantasy, like Mom and Dad, Mom and Dad
There’s no sex, only fucking
Janie’s growing little tits, Jimmy’s learning to repress All his female tedencies Like you and me, you and me, baby There’s no out there is no escape, if you want to copulate You must learn the masterplan It’s—be like I am, be like I am
There’s no sex, only fucking
I am man, you said I am And she’s a girl, her hair is curled We’re not the same, it’s very strange We walk in line, we dance in time No one wants to break the rule cause if you do The rules will break you
If you use the verb `to be`, you refer to how you pee And if you choose to sit not stand, Janie you are not a man There’s a door you can get through, the other is not meant for you Little Dickie, use your eyes, it means no penis need aplly
There’s no sex, only fucking Everyone’s got a hole and everyone’s got stiff little fingers You don’t have to know You don’t have to be so particular  
Rich guns
I hear the rich guns go pop pop, Arriba! All this noise has got to stop, Arriba! All those burns who have no cash, they’re lazy! And if they think they’re getting ours, they’re crazy! See them mill around, hear theri angry talk We will mow them down, we will make them stop
There are people we admire, Arriba! Those with courage under fire, Arriba! We will give them uniforms, Il Duce! We will pay them to perform, Il Duce! Hear the tramping feet of our hired guns Doesn’t it sound sweet, isn’t this such fun
Hear the bullets fly, see the people die, hear the children cry I hear the rich guns go pop pop
We will send them all around, Arriba! To kill the fucking underground, Arriba! Rape the women, they’re whores, Las Putas! Everything they have is yours, Las Putas! We just want to stay in our safely homes The chairs onm which we sit are made of human bones
Hear the bullets fly, see the people die, hear children cry I hear the rich guns go pop pop
Living in detente
Living in detente where buildings grow so great All the windows are black in secret state Muttered voices with points that they must make Rules of order that we’ll negotiate Living in detente is so enterprising, everyone loves the suspense Living in detente is just where I want to live
You won’t find it on any map cause it Lies somewhere between peace and wartime, it’s One up on the Joneses, a vicious cycle where Overthrow is check, overkill is mate Living in detente i so mesmeriszing, erverone walks in a daze Living in detente where questions make dancers of people whos stories aren’t straight
It’s so quiet, it’s so cool, it’s so cold
Living in detente is just where I want to be  
Try not to stutter
I got a two ton wreck wrapped around my neck A weekend bender, on bustend suspender I’ve aged three years, cried a couple of tears I told the cop i coul’nt remember When i saw you Where you were Who you were with I only wish that you both would phone And try not to surrender I told the judge i couldn’t remember
And as you are answering all of their questions I have just got one suggestion
Try not to stutter
I was Jo Cool for an indian summer A camp fire wag, a long distance runner I had the big eyes following my every move But icouldn’t let down or I’d lose There was a snot nose kid trying to blow my cover If they won’t buy that I’ll tell them another Then two of the boys shot down my noised The one with the van and his brother
They casually mentioned a couple of kids An unspoken challenge, ok here
Try not to stutter
She was of to base to know the meaning of fear With her cutt-offs swaying from here to there The music’s her maker, the giver the taker That’s what i hear She smiled so fine, but not very friendly With a studied wink, „Oh Baby you sned me!“
You’ve got a box full of trophies that’s what i hear
And as you try to fashion the perfetct time There’s just one thing to keep in mind
Try not to stutter
(you can mumble, soft and low, mutter mutter so they think you know,  but there’s just one thing that has got to go)
Try not to stutter  
No rest for the wicked  
We are you, you are not We are you, you are not We crawl down, you jump up We crawl down, you jump up You are not you
I know There’s no let up There’s no peace, no rest Not for the wicked No rest for the wicked
What are thou, thou art not What are thou, thou art not You climb up, you’re dragged up You climb up, you’re dragged up You are not you
I know There’s no let up There’s no peace, no rest Not for the wicked No rest for the wicked  
I’m all wet
(go into mediation)
I’m all wet My feet don’t work, I’m getting a new seat I am that gleam in the baby’s eye As he grabs the Lysol and gives it a try Not dead yet
Here we are on the move again Riding the skies in a DC-10 The movie’s a scream, there’s a couple of stars Raping a girl in the back of a car I am that crashing jet
I’m all wet I’m not dead yet, there’s a hole in the fishnet I am that face on a rainy night That stares eyes wide open into you headlights I’m all wet
I am that love you can never forget I am the balance and you are the dept Your payments are due, I’m the voice on the phone Sell of your car, mortage your home I am that cancelled cheque
I’m all wet I’m not dead yet
I’m not dead yet I’m not dead yet  
Approaching zero
Hardly warm you’re not feeling normal Your pulse is faded, could use first aid Now you private matters need looking after It’s way too late, though, the show can’t wait It’s a private screening of life’s last gleaming Your private glory, your personal story And you’re the hero, approaching zero
Now, now, now Speak your last line
Make it good `cause your tongues like wood You’ve got sticks for your arms, it’s no false alarm It’s your last hurray, the final straw And i’m not sory, it’s not my worry ´Cause I’m the knife that is full of life Where there once was we, now there’s only me And you’re the hero, approaching zero
Now, now, now Speak your last line
Should I’ve warned you that I’m not normal It’s build on tears full of nagging tears And there is no cure, now it’s too obscure It’s TV movies, it’s Punch and Judy It’s things obscene on the shining screen It’s a killer’s story, a monent’s glory And you’re the hero, approaching zero Yes, you’re the hero, approaching zero  
Forget your life
Now if you feel Like nothing Nothing and no one
And if you see Nothing Nothing and no one
Forget your life It’s nothing
Now if you  Cringe and shrink inside Byt say nothing Nothing to no one
Forget your life It’s nothing
You’re hiding Why are you hiding? That’s nothing That’s nothing
You’re scared  What are you scared of? That’s nothing That’s nothing
Forget your life It’s nothing
Forget it

 SEX MAD
I have to have you far too much
I have to grab I have to touch
I have to feel your every curve
I have to stir each little nerve
I want the pleasure I want the pain
I want to overload my brain
I'm going SEX MAD

Oh, to be buried in your chest
Or steamy breath and gripping bone

I simply have to copulate
The more I see the more I want
The more I see the more I want
I'm going
SEX MAD SEX MAD SEX MAD SEX MAD.

DAD

I want home, I was feeling so alone
I was late, it was my mistake
I want to my room and sat there in the gloom
I know I've been bad, I know he'll be mad
I hear him coming down the hell
And there's nowhere to go, nowhere at all
I've been had, it was my mistake
He opens the door, his eyes are full of hate

DAD NO! DAD, LEAVE ME ALONE! DAD, NO! DAD, LET ME GO!
DAD NO! DAD, LEAVE ME ALONE! DAD, NO! OH, MY GOD, NO!
NO!

My mom comes rushing in, she says "Please, don't hurt
him" DAD gives her a kick, he slaps her around a bit, he
says: "SHUT UP, YOU BITCH! SHUT UP, YOU BITCH! I'll
KILL YOU! I'll KILL YOU! SHUT UP, I'll KILL YOU!"

DAD keeps hitting mom's face, and there's blood all over the
place I seid, 'Please DAD, please! It es my mistake! I'm the one
that's bad! I'm the one that's bad! Don't hit her DAM Don't hit her
DAD!"

DAD NO! DAD, LEAVE HER ALONE! DAD, LET HER GO! NO!
NO! DAD NO! DAD, LET HER GO! OH, MY GOD! NO! NO!

He want into my sister's room and he locked the
door He seid, "I hate you, but I love you more." I
heard her crying as the light want out I heard her
scream, I had to shout:

DAD NO! DAD, LEAVE HER ALONE! DAD, LET HER GO! NO!
NO! DAD NO! DAD, LET HER GO! OH, MY GOD! NO! NO!

I'm seriously considering leaving home.

LOVE THANG

You must feel funny. You must feel flattered
I heard you wem sick. He must be very worried
This is what true love is all about  hunger
Get out your valentines. Get out your revolver

We all know
He had a love thing
And he's got something for you
You have a thing for him

A chance romance one in 200 million
You betrayed your duty. It might have been a lovely wedding
I'm sure he forgives you for what you did to him
Sand him a postcard. Maybe you two could go out on a date

I know, I was in love once
I had a love thing and he's got something for you
You have a thing for him

So what am you going to do
Are you going to be so stupid? Don't be so fucking stupid
What are you going to do?
Put yourself away in one of those books
"Whatever happened to?"
I love you

Don't look so surprised I mean that he tried to kill
the guy It's just an extension of what we all feel for
each other At some point in our lives.

Don't look so surprised I mean that he tried to kill

DEAD BOB

Quiet es a mouse
Gentle es a lamb
Happy es a clam
Dead es a...
Doorknob

Roses am red
Violets are blue
I hung myself
So fuck you

DEAD BOB

Button up your overcoat
When the skies are gray
Put a rope around your neck
And kick the chair away
My father was of the sky
My mother was of the earth
And I am a stupid cringing
Ignorant fucking little goof

DEAD BOB

Everyone is so polite
So completely awfully nice
I'm going to get a butcher knife
And cut you all a juicy slice
Mary had a little lamb
And the she had some veal
She stuck her finger down her throat
And threw up...
Everything

I will leave a little note
Hanging from a knotted rope
Please excuse my thoughlessness
I am sorry for the mess

ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?

SELF PITY

Nobody lows me. Like I do
Nobody loves me. Like I do

Self pity

I can't do anything. What can I
do? I can't do anything. What
can I do?

Self pity

I'm touching myself. But it disgusts me
I'm touching myself. But it disgusts me

Self pity

I'm sleeping late. I'm cutting classes
I'm cutting classes. I'm sleeping late

Self pity

Try to help me. I won't help you
Try to help me. I won't help you

Self pity

Come on an'give me my drugs, give me my drugs...
GIVE ME MY DRUGS

Self pity, self love, self.

LONG DAYS

I grew days
I grew them long
I grew them short
I wasted them all away
LONG DAYS...
I wasted them away

Count the hours
Count the minutes
Look into that hole
Can you see what's in it?
LONG DAYS
I wasted them away

See them stretch 
Far behind me 
See them crouch 
Right behind me 
See them pass 
Right beside me 
See them stretch 
Out before me 
LONG DAYS... 
I wasted them away.

METRONOME

I want to break the things that seek
To control, I want to live my life with
No rules at all, I want to smash the
Lips that smile down on me, I want
To rip and teer until I am free

Steady, keep it, steady
METRONOME

I want to touch the places lost deep
Inside, I want to see the ugly faces
That hide, I want to mach down to the
End of what's there, I went to strip
The surface till all is bare

Steady, keep it, steady
METRONOME

I want to jump out of my skin and be 
Free, I want to kill the little thing that 
Is me, I want to laugh and giggle, I want 
To scream, I want to wake up from this 
Life crushing dream, I want to wash my 
Body bare in the stream, I want to 
Liberate this human machine, I want to spit 
And grovel I want to shit, I want to 
Make you wonder what is it? What 
Is it?

You know one thing that I think attracts people 
To a steady beat, to a steady beat, is the certainty 
Of where it will be, of where it will be, in the next 
Moment, its inevitability with no variation, the 
Comfort and security of knowing what and who you 
are, you hear that beat, you hear that beat, it's 
Beating on you, it's beating on me, you hear that beat, 
You hear that beat, it's beating on you, it's 
Beating on you.

REVENGE

You've spread your wings and learned to fly
You've tried and tried and now you've succeeded
Weil, that's too bad, that's too bad, that's too bad
I'm alive, that's too bad, that's too bad
Open your eyes, Revenge, open your eyes
Revenge, open wide

You've fooled them once, you've fooled them twice
They think you're nice but NO, you're just clever
That's too bad, that's too bad, that's too bad
My friend, that's too bad, that's too bad
THIS IS THE END, Revenge, YOU DIE, YOU DIE
Revenge,

You want to know WHY? You want to know WHY?
You DIE? YOU DIE? You want to know WHY?
You want to know WHY? YOU DIE! YOU DIE!
That's too bad, that's too bad, that's too bad, I'm ALIVE
That's too bad, that's too bad, I WILL SURVIVE
AND THE BAND PLAYED SOME GOOD'OLE
ROCK'N'ROLL

WHAT I WANT MOST IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD 
IS A GIRL JUST A GIRL ONE WHO WILL KEEP ME 
FROM LOSING MY MIND ONE WHO WILL KEEP ME 
FROM LOSING MY MIND AND SHE'LL BE THE BEST 
GIRL IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD SHE'LL BE THE 
BEST GIRL IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD 
REVENGE YOU DIE! YOU DIE! YOU DIE!

REVENGE.

HUNT THE SHE BEAST

Laugh you asshole and try to be brave
My God, what a strenge shape
Drooling jaws are my dmams landwape
I am so tough and so afraid
Give it up, get it up, give it up, get it up
With spear, sword and blade
With spear, sword and blade

Hunt the She Beast
Mama bear is there, beware
Hunt the She Beast

We got together because it was so fucking cold
And we knew the answer wasn't in the stars
Or in the soil, it was in blood
In a bloody run down to the sea, in a bloody run
Down to the sea, in a run down to the sun and the sea

H u nt the She Beast
She bear, she bears the furies
Hunt the She Beast

Now I own everything and I have all the answers
Kingdom come like my father before and my son after
And it's power that has brought me here
Brains and power and the fear
The fear you've got to control
You've got to keep the women down below
Cause them was something here before
The fear you've got to control
There is something down in that hole

Hunt the She Beast

And now there's nothing left to kill
You've bent the whole world to your will
When you reach out your mighty hand
There's nothing left but barren sand
You run and run and run
But you've forgotten what you're running from
You're flying into emptiness
And all that's left for you is death
Now we don't need no prophets of doorn
We need prophets of the womb
Deny your cruel mythology
Your fear inspired symbology
The circling arms of mother night
Will craddle your small fire light
From now on when I hunt to see
She - what do I see?
From now on when I hunt to see
She - what do I see?
A single
Simple
Human Being

Hunt the She Beast She bear, 
she bears the futum Hunt the She Beast.

BODYBAG

They say the eyes am the windows of the soul 
but I love all the little dark holes in your 
BODY BAG. 
Your little willie, he's oh, so pretty, 
And those titties, and those titties in the 
BODY BAG.

Nobody knows you and nobody wants to.

Willie's poised to dive into flesh, 
Something teils me he will leave a mess in the 
BODY BAG. 
When we kiss my eyes am closed, 
my lips are full, I breathe through my nose in the 
BODY BAG.

Nobody knows you and nobody wants to.

See the children play in the mud, 
moulding balls of faces and blood from the 
BODY BAG. 
All preise for corporal flesh; 
the smell of love the smell of death from the 
BODY BAG.. 

NO FUCKING

All I see are cocks and cunts
All I hear are push and grunts
I don' like it

DARK AGES
We are living in the, in the dark ages 
Haven't seen some daylight in what seems ages 
All the information is locked far beyond 
Locked in circuits and bathed in silicon 
And we're fast asleep with our dreams seething in 

And though all is still we are still breathing 
But it's him in the dark, he makes me null and void 
But it's him in the dark, 
I think I m paranoid 
A world of half-truths, what goes 
Unspoken lines of communication are stripped and broken 
And the dark is cold with hands freezing 
But this deep-freeze seems strangely pleasing 
And the powr-trippers receive facelifts 
And the button-pushers all work night shifts 
And the misdemeanors seem so ghastly while the media punch is so lasting 
And the eastern comrades find out much too late 
And free men are free to subjugate under megashadow, under nine to five 
Still it's self-extinction that keeps us alive 

We are living in the, in the dark ages haven't seen some daylight in what seems ages 
All the information is locked far beyond 
Locked in circuits and bathed in silicon 
I don't know go to sleep we are in the dark ages 

JUNK

He thought he was putting his things in the right place 
Everything had a name and everything had a place 
But now there's so much of this stuff around 
That when we look down on the ground 
There is nothing there to see 
Well, you're probably saying to yourself, 
„I guess they buried it somewhere else" 
Wait a minute, wait a minute, please wait a minute 
Just bend your neck, just crane your neck, just twist your neck 
But don't break your neck and look above you, look above you 
Above us is the garbage, below us is the earth 
Above us is the garbage, below us is the earth 
And each day, each hour, each minute, each second 
We're crawling, crawling, clawing, falling more, more, more, more it's junk 

AND THAT'S SAD

We should not make a fuss what would become of us 
We should not 
And that's sad and that's sad 
We must hold on tight 
Hold on with all our might all our might 
And that's sad 
I demand what you should be in the name of decency 
You'd do the same for me and that's sad 

SMALL PARTS ISOLATED AND DESTROYED

It's been said before but I ll repeat it 
Don't you feel like you've been cheated? 
It's been shoved down your throats, you eat it 
They say it's true, you believe it 

chorus: 
Small parts isolated and destroyed 
See the big boys play with their toys 
There is one thing I will never do 
Trust you 
There's one thing that I have learned 
All god's children will get burned 
And if it comes down to me or you 
Who do you think I will choose? 
What's the deal? 50% of the door? 
Well, then, come on in, come on in for more 
What's that you say, we get a guarantee? 
Then fuck right off, you mean nothing to me 
Isn't this a sweet romance so why don't you get off your ass and dance? 
"What about me? What about me? Can I get in for free? Can I get in for free? 
You know me, you remember me 
Can I get in for free? can I get in for free?" 
Come on in! Come on in for free! 
Don't mind the heat, don't mind the smoke 
All that screaming? It's just a joke all that screaming? 
Nah, it's just a joke come on in! Come on in for free! Come on in! 
It's on me! The joke's on me 
I'm tired of being close and feeling abused 
And all those deep discussions make me wanna puke 
And you're all going to see a lot less of me 
I'm not the comrade that you hoped I d be 

chorus: 

Everybody's in the groove filling the dance floor, 
Two by two (hey boy, I might want to fuck you) (hey girl, I might want to fuck you too) 
There's liquor on your breath and magic in the air 
Now we're really going to get somewhere 
This is for all you girls and boys 
Small parts isolated and destroyed 
It's too late baby It's too late man oh baby, oh baby 
You've been beaten up inside 
You've been beaten up inside 
That's the high point of your life 
That's the high point of your life 
I was beaten but I died (or is that just another lie?) 
It's been said before but I ll repeat it 
Don't you feel like you've been cheated? 
It's been shoved down your throats, you eat it 
They say it's true, you believe it 
Small parts isolated and destroyed 
I'd rather die than be a toy 
There is one thing I will never do 
Trust you 

VICTORY

When I set out on this journey I thought it would never end 
When I started down that road I could not see the end 
And when I took that first step I fell in so deep 
And all those things that were so hard-won I thought I would always keep 
Now what do you think I see standing like a wall in front of me 

Defeat, not victory 
Defeat, not victory 
Defeat, not victory 

chorus:
So what are you going to do? Die? 
No you gonna lay down and die? 
No I will not admit defeat I will not admit defeat 
I will see victory 
Pride and deceit have choked my life like weeds 
And I lost sight of what I really had what I really need 
And all the things I should've valued 
I gave away for a prayer and a song 
And now when I reach out for them they are gone 
Now you know what I see standing in front of me 
Like a headstone a fucking monument to human misery 

Defeat, not victory 
Defeat, not victory 
Defeat, not victory 

chorus: 

Do I have any friends here? 
I can't see are any of my friends here? 
I can't see what about you? 
Will you be a friend to me? 
What about you? Will you be a friend to me? 
I've got a question to ask you and then you can ask it of me 
It's a simple request and then you can make it of me 
Can you forgive me? Can you see what will be? 
Is it victory? 

Now I can't show you all the things I ve seen 
And I can't make you feel anything 
Certainly not what they meant to me 
And someday I know, no matter how hard we try 
We are all going to have to lay down and die 
So maybe I should just tell you what I hope and believe 
For every defeat there will be a victory 
For every defeat there will be a victory in defeat, 
victory 

TERESA, GIVE ME THAT KNIFE

Can you picture me standing there? 
I see it can you picture me way up there? 
I see it now my whole life 
I see it now my whole damn life 
Teresa, what would you die for? What would you die for? 
What would you die for, teresa? What would you die for? 

Teresa, give me that knife give me 
That knife teresa, give me that knife give me that knife teresa 
Can you picture me there? 
There I m almost there 
I'm almost there I m almost there 
Teresa, what would you die for? What would you die for? 
What would you die for, teresa? What would you die for? 
Teresa, give me that knife teresa, give me that knife teresa, 
Give me that knife teresa, give me that knife teresa 

REAL LOVE

Real love is scary 
You try to hide when it looks for you 
You never know what it will do 
Not real love 
Not real love 
Real love is a long stone bed, he said his face a mask of indifference 
And it don't care about me or you 
Not real love 
Not real love 

Real love on a sunny day is a crow on a telephone pole with something to say 
And you feel like someone has just walked on your grave 
That's real love That's real love 
The glory of love The glory of love 
That precious rain that falls from above 
First a gentle murmur that calls from the heart 
And then a great wind that will blow you apart 
That's real love 
That's real love 

Like a ghost it will pass right through you 
A spirit that lives on when you are through 
And there is nothing that you can do 
The wind in the trees 
The smell of wet leaves 
The rumble of a passing truck 
A streak of blood 
Please forgive me for what I ve done to you 
And lord forgive me for what I m going to do 
In the name of... 

Real love is scary 
You try to hide when it looks for you 
You never know what it will do 
And it don't care about me or you 
And there is nothing you can do about real love anyway, 
That's what I heard a crow say but who cares what a crow say anyway? 
Especially about something, something something so strictly personal (real love) 
Can you feel it? Can you feel it? 
That wind on your face 
You can get down on your knees and pray 
But nothing that you do or say will make it go away (real love) 
It's like thunder, 
Like lightning the way 
You love me the way you love me 
The way you love me it's frightening 

LONELY

You tell me I should not be all by myself, 
That's good advice 
I'll hum a tune and break the ice 'cos I m lonely 
Everyone looks good to me 
But I m afraid that I can see that good intent and honesty do not redeem stupidity 
When all is said and all is done 
You either know or down you go into the pit of shallow wit with all the other hypocrites 
You're not bad, you're not good 
You're a solid block of wood 
You have eyes but cannot see why I despise your company 
I am lonely 
People come, people go 
They put on their little shows 
See them laugh, see them cry 
See them live their little lies 
I'm alone with you and I m lying too 
I'm alone with you and you're lying too 
Oh, we are all liars and that's all that's true 
I'm alone with you I m alone with you 
I'm lonely lonely lonely just a lonely guy. 
Yup, that's me... 

It's Catching up
Have you heard the news?
The dead walk..

Do you hear that sound?
Do you hear that sound?
Like fingers scratching underground?
Do you hear that sound?
That slamming door?
I’ve fought it all my life
But I can‘t fight it anymore

It‘s catching up, I‘m fucked
A dead duck, shit outta luck

How do you hide from
Something you have found?

Do you hear that sound?
That scratching sound?
Ii it better to be lost or found?
You can‘t ignore it
You can’t talk it away
You can’t drink it away
You can’t fuck it away

It‘s catching up, I‘m fucked
A dead duck, shit outta luck

Give my asylum, let me in
I am mad, you are my only witness

There are some things that never die
Things that really never were alive
I’ve shut them out
I’ve slammed th door
But i can’t keep them back
Anymore

It‘s catching up, I‘m fucked
A dead duck, shit outta luck

The Tower

The sword of thruth is just another weapon
Let me live for one more second
I see a woman she’s holding flowers
A bouquet of roses that are blood red
From a burning building, a man leaps to his death
I stand above these mansions of the death
Red tombs and above us looms
The Tower

I see red
I see a tower against the sky
Beneath a red unblinking eye

Radiowaves curve and cross
I stand below them – Lost !
Above me is a black obelisk
And the dangers that i risk
Here gather the ghosts of the mind
That tear my heard and here i find
All that traps that have been set
Everything i would forget, beneath
The Tower

I see red
I see a tower against the sky
Beneath a red unblinking eye

Violence is close at hand
You are damned if you do
And if you don’t – Dammed !
A red eye, A tyrant full of hate
Glares from the sky, It’s captive state
If it should blink ordeviate
A thousand words would obliterate
I do not move, nor do i speak
Beneath that hard and pitiless peak
Of concrete , steel and antennae wheels
The Tower

I see red
I see a tower against the sky
Beneath a red unblinking eye

Brainless Wonder

I need lunch
Feed my now
I need lunch
When’s my break?!!!

Tired of waiting

I got tired, tired of waiting

Tired of waiting, waiting for the news
Tired of waiting for things to improve
Tired of waiting, waiting for your letter
Tired of waiting for things to get better

I got tired, tired, tired of waiting

Tired of waiting, waiting for the phone
Tired of waiting, ere all alone
Tired of waiting for something new
Tired of waiting for you

I got tired, tired, tired of waiting

I got tired of waiting, waiting in line
Tired of waiting for my clothes to dry
Tired of waiting for his show to begin
Tired of waiting for my ship to come in
Tired of waiting, waiting for the bus
Tired of waiting for my shoes to get fixed
Tired of waiting, waiting for my cheque
Tired of waiting for a change in the weather
Tired of waiting the water to boil
Tired of waitingthe paint to dry
Tired of waiting, waiting for a sign
Tired of waiting for my big break
Tired of waiting for the dam to break
Tired of waiting for the bomb to drop
Tired of waiting and waiting and waiting
I got tired of waiting for the end

I got tired of waiting because i found out
There’s only a fine line between
Biding one’s time and waisting one’s time

Do you know what i mean?

I got tired of waiting that’s all

Stocktaking

Are you getting whta you want?
And are you geting what you need?
I’ve heard it said that love is truelly sacred
But nowhere is written that’s guarenteed

Who decides what will happen?
And who decides what for?
Is it just a crazy little game?
Or is ist just an ugly little war?

Are you sick an tired of the same old thing?
Or are you happy enough?
When does so much become so little?
When does so little become so much?

The end of all things

You are here
I am here
Fear
Bound in fear
We are here
I see nothing

All is clear
Crystal clear
Fear
All that’s here
Pain and fear
I see here
Nothing

Hear the angls sing
Thi si the ned of all things
All is clear
Nothing‘s here
Fear
What is fear?
Nothing’s here
I see here
Nothing

Hear the angels sing
This is the end of all things

Big Dick

Like a monkey in the zoo
You’re half gorilla too
When you pound it with your fist
And make it real stiff
Big dick
Gotta cover your mistake
Your bloody outtakes
So you dip it in the wine
And make a holy sign
Big dick

Big dick! Come quick
Big dick! Come quick

Well you’re running up a tree
You’re trying not too sream
But you are pounding on your chest
Like you wipped the best
Big dick
The rivers of blood
You’ve spilled have turned to mud
Now the flies are buzzin‘ round
Don’t it make a loud sound
Big dick

Big dick! Come quick
Big dick! Come quick

It won’t be long
Till those bad bits are gone
It won’t be long
Till those bad bits are gone

Now we are sitting by the fire
But daddy’s getting tired
`cause hes drunk the whole crock
now he’s got a limp cock
Big dick

Big dick! Come quick
Big dick! Come quick
 

Two lips, two lungs and one tongue

He kept trying
He kept trying
But he couldn’t find out
Why he couldn’t stop crying
Only so many songs can be sung
With two lips, two lungs and one tongue

She kept praying
She kept praying
That she would understand
What she was saying

Only so many songs can be sung
With two lips, two lungs and one tongue

He kept dreaming
He kept dreaming
Of the day they’d realize
What he was feeling

Only so many songs can be sung
With two lips, two lungs and one tongue

Rags and bones

Chirst was married on the cross
My father was married to my mother
Am aim married to a cigarette butt
Lying in the gutter

Rags and bones
Are we finally alone?

White man, you
You just started to get the blues
White man, you
You just started to get the blues

Rags and bones
Are we finally alone?

The beast has arisen
The sins are forgiven
In the belly of the beast
I shall be released
She rises captain!
Captain dive! Dive!
If i could choose to belive
Or not to believe
You know i would choose not to
If i could choose to belive
Or not to believe
You know i would choose not to
But i can’t coose

Rags and bones
Are we finally alone?

Whoo would’ve thought that i would be
A sailor on the deep blue sea
Any old rags and bones?

Oh no! Bruno!

Too much, stay out all night
Too much, but that’s alright

All lies

Lies are the words i use
When you look up hopefully
All of the things that we feel
Are a trick, a fantasy
What is the end?
Is it love i prtend?
It’s calling, It’s calling
And i’m falling, I’m falling
And she said pray to me, pray to me
All the love you see, it comes from me
She said pray to me, pray to me
All the love you see, it comes from me
She said I see, I see, I see, I see
She said pray to me, pray to me
Pray to me, pray to me, but it was

All lies, a pack of lies, it was all lies
Why don’t you fuck of and die
It was all liesm a pack of lies
It was all lies, all lies

Lies are the light and hope
In your eyes as they shine on me
Tie up my hands with your chains
They are bound to set me free
I’m singin, I’m singing
And o that i’m clinging
The word that i say
Only drag me away
And i say pray to me, pray to me
All the love i see comes from me
I say pray to me, pray to me
All the love i see belongs to me

I said I see, I see, I see, I see
I said pray to me, pray to me
Pray to me, pray to me, but it was

All lies...

Lies are the hopes anf the chains
That have dragged me here to you
All the hopes and these chains
I will gladly share with you

It’s raining, it’s pouring
The old man is snoring
It’s raining it’s pouring
And i’m falling, I’m falling
And she said pray to me, pray to me
All the love you see, it comes from me
He say pray to me, pray to me
All the love i see belongs to me
He said I see, I see, I see, I see
He say pray to me, pray to me
Pray to me, pray to me, but it was

All lies..

Life in Hell

Foolish girl in swelling woman
Here’s a blunt knife for your bosom
Here’s the devil’s hand to shake
Watch whta the others try to take

Hell
Life in hell

By your loving disposition
You let him get into position
And train his rising gun upon
The cevrix of your inner sun

Hell
Life in hell

Can you not distinguish pain?
Red nail and red shame

Woman, world in one complete
Your heart’s awake, your mind’s asleep
You spread your inner sun to make
A den for some sly, bassing snake

Which burns stronger?
I can’t tell
Thw glowing sun?
Or fiery hell?

Hell
Life in hell

I am Wrong

I know What i know
I’m no hero
Say yes, say no
Don’ come,, come close
Wrong

Be strong, be strong
Don’t be all wrong
Don’t wait or hesitate
Take care, beware
Wrong

I am wrong

I fell great, let’s celebrate
It’s sunny day, let’s dance and play
Never fear, love is here
Never fear, love is..

Be straight, don’t lie
Don’t tell, tell why
I know what i know
I’m no hero
Wrong

I fell great, let’s celebrate
It’s sunny day, let’s dance and play
Never fear, love is here
Never fear, love is..

Step into my palour
Said the spider to the fly
And we could share a love
That would never die

I know what i know
I’m no hero
Don’t wait or hesitate
Be strong
Be wrong

I am wrong


"China Boys"

Ten billion people living in one room
I hear them singing a simple tune
I hear them calling
I'm after you
I want your trousers
I want your shoes
Roll out red carpets
Here come the china boys
Roll out red carpets
Here come the china boys

Ten billion people knocking on your door
I want to stay here
Sleep on the floor
I hear them laughing
I know where you are
I don't want your TV
I want your car
Roll out red carpets
Here come the china boys
Roll out red carpets
Here come the china boys

Ten billion people across the sea
Ten billion people like you and me
I see them smiling
They think it's fun
They've got some rowboats
They've got some guns
Roll out red carpets
Where are the china boys
Roll out red carpets
Here come the china boys

hastings street
said i'm living down hastings street
got the whole world at my feet
i did my best and i tried not to quit
hiding away in my sketchy bedsit
and i didn't know my heroes
looks like my future's a mess
there are people who are starving all over this place
lines on the forehead and down my face 
and i didn't want to grow up this fast
i thought my fun would last
there's nothing left to shout about
nothing worth dying for
there's no one here, just me and my problems
even my dreams of escaping
well now there's no room at the top
see i've grown unfriendly and i trust no one
lord i wish i could turn the picture back
see i'm living in the scene from a cop show
and even the good guys are bad
proud men you used to have to buy them
now you're got to dry them
i didn't want to grow up this fast
i thought my fun would last
there's nothing left to shout about
nothing worth dying for
there's no one here, just me and my problems
scream like a knife cutting silence
god i have? at the dark
things didn't turn out the way that i planned
losing my life in this old man's land
living down hastings street
the world at my feet 
i did my best and i tried not to quit
hiding away in my sketchy bedsit
i didn't want to grow up this fast
i thought my fun would last
there's nothing left to shout about
nothing worth dying for
there's no one here, just me and my problems
there's nothing left to shout about
nothing worth dying for
there's no one here, just me and my problems

"Eyes Of A Stranger"

Can I touch you to see if you're real?
Is it nothing the something I feel?
Will my heart take the strain,
Or will it break down again?

In your lips I sense a danger
You've got the eyes of a stranger

Have I been sleeping for all these years?
Is it magic that makes you appear?
When you walked in the room
I felt my heart race
But I knew I'd been fooled
When I looked at your face

In your lips I sense a danger
You've got the eyes of a stranger
In your lips I see a danger
You've got the eyes of a stranger

In your lips I sense a danger
You've got the eyes of a stranger
In your lips I see a danger
You've got the eyes of a stranger
You've got the eyes of a stranger
You've got the eyes of a stranger
You've got the eyes of a stranger
You've got the eyes of a stranger

what do you want me to do
You walked out took your chance
You turned your back on our romance
You said you'd found somebody new
You said the change would do you good

But then the bubble burst your dream
Turned into a nightmare scream
He pushed you till you nearly cracked
But now you say you want me back

But baby, baby, what do you want me to do (what do you want me to do)
Say that I need you more (need you more)
Is that what real lovers do (is that what real lovers do)
Or only what you use me for (use me for)

You never even gave me a thought
You figured that I'd be alright
I never had a chance to persuade you
You never let me put up a fight

You wanted that boy so bad
Until you found out that you'd been had
You came crawling to me on your knees
Asking me to love you please

But baby, baby, what do you want me to do (what do you want me to do)
Say that I need you more (need you more)
Is that what real lovers do (is that what real lovers do)
Or only what you use me for (use me for)

But baby, baby, what do you want me to do (what do you want me to do)
Say that I need you more (need you more)
Is that what real lovers do (is that what real lovers do)
Or only what you use me for (use me for)

So what do you want me to do (what do you want me to do)
What do you want me to do (what do you want me to do)
What do you want me to do (what do you want me to do)
What do you want me to do (what do you want me to do)
Oh what do you want me to do (what do you want me to do)
Oh what do you want me to do, baby (what do you want me to do)
What do you want me to do (what do you want me to do)
What do you want me to do, baby (what do you want me to do)
What do you want me to do (what do you want me to do)
What do you want me to do (what do you want me to do)
What do you want me to do (what do you want me to do)
What do you want me to do (what do you want me to do)

somebody's mom
Please don't look at me
I've seen all that I want to see
You take your cigarettes and light them
Forty year old household item
You've got housewifeitis
With a terminal solution
Your face is like a preview of
September's Television

And you're somebody's Mom (Mom)
Even if you're just a lazy useless bum
And you married somebody's dad (Dad)
If I had been your children I sure would have been mad

And now you say your husband's queer
Running with the secretary
While you stay home and cure your ills
With sedatives and other pills

And you're somebody's Mom (Mom)
Even if you're just a lazy useless bum
And you married somebody's dad (Dad)
If I had been your children I sure would have been mad

And you're somebody's Mom (Mom)
Even if you're just a lazy useless bum
And you married somebody's dad (Dad)
If I had been your children I sure would have been mad

And you're somebody's, you're somebody's (Mom)
You're somebody's, you're somebody's (Mom)
You're somebody's, you're somebody's (Mom)
You're somebody's, you're somebody's, you're somebody's (Mom)

out of luck
I never ever wanted to get too close to you
I didn't wanna fall in love
They'd tell me all the stories of the boys and their glory
Nearly died when you gave them the shove
But I fell for you honey, now I'm feeling funny
Like maybe I'm the next in line
I guess I'm just another guy out of luck, whoa-whoa
I guess this time I've just run out of luck

Because you always told me that when we were together
You were happy for the very first time,
I'd look into your blue eyes and figured that you meant it
And that everybody else was lying

But now you come and tell me that you really like me
And you hope that we can still be friends,
I guess I'm just another guy out of luck, whoa-whoa
I guess this time I've just run out of luck

Now I know, you never really loved me anyway
But who cares, I learned from you just the same
And it's true, you cheapened yourself to better me
Cause I'm sure, I'll never fall for your kind again

Now I know, you never really loved me anyway
But who cares, I learned from you just the same
And it's true, you cheapened yourself to better me
Cause I'm sure, I'll never fall for your kind again

I never ever wanted to get too close to you
I didn't wanna fall in love
They'd tell me all the stories of the boys and their glory
Nearly died when you gave them the shove

But I fell for you honey, now I'm feeling funny
Like maybe I'm the next in line
I guess I'm just another guy out of luck, whoa-whoa
I guess I'm just another guy out of luck, whoa-whoa
I guess I'm just another guy out of luck, whoa-whoa
I guess this time I've just run out of luck

marching song
Like Germany in '43 everyone was down on me
And things were closing in
My ideals, all my dreams, breaking out at the seams
Without discipline
No one wanted to believe me
I was up against a wall
When she came marching in to save me
Like a guardian general
She had it worked out to an art
And now she's in command of my heart

Leather boots, thin black tie, monocle in one eye
She's so military
Well I was broken, I was dirty, but she promised not to hurt me
Such humanity
No one ever understood me
I had visions, I had plans
She mapped out the way it could be
Offered me her stiff right hand
She had it worked out to an art
And now she's in command of my heart

She gives the orders, she's got taste, she puts everything in place
With such authority
She tells me why, she shows me how, there's not a thing to stop me now
I've got validity
All the times I've had to bow out
All the chances that I've missed
But I've got re-enforcements now
It is useless to resist
She had it worked out to an art
And now she's in command of my heart
She had it worked out to an art
And now she's in command of my heart
She's in command of my heart
Yeah she's in command of my heart

perfect youth
Here comes the latest crowd
They're the kids with common view
They always look so they make you feel so old
Emotions running out of control
They have to act on intuition
And live fast for just one night and forget about tomorrow

And I think that's perfect (perfect youth)
It only happens when you're young (perfect youth)
And if you're perfect (perfect youth)
There isn't any right or wrong (perfect youth)

I used to be just like them
It's the air of confidence
Of course the styles have changed since my day about two weeks ago
But no, I don't feel bitter
This is what must happen
I lived with the realization
While they fulfill their obligations

And I think that's perfect (perfect youth)
It only happens when you're young (perfect youth)
And if you're perfect (perfect youth)
There isn't any right or wrong (perfect youth)

So face front you young Canadians
This time is yours to spend they way you choose
You just can't lose
So don't worry

And I think that's perfect (perfect youth)
It only happens when you're young (perfect youth)
And if you're perfect (perfect youth)
There isn't any right or wrong (perfect youth)

Yeah I think that's perfect (perfect youth)
It only happens when you're young (perfect youth)
And if you're perfect (perfect youth)
There isn't any right or wrong (perfect youth)

So perfect (perfect youth)
So perfect (perfect youth)
So perfect (perfect youth)
You think you're so perfect (perfect youth)
So perfect (perfect youth)
So perfect (perfect youth)
So perfect (perfect youth)
So perfect (perfect youth)
So perfect (perfect youth)
You think you're so perfect (perfect youth)
You think you're so perfect (perfect youth)
You're so so so perfect (perfect youth)
You think you're so perfect (perfect youth)

when she's alone
Her Mom and Dad didn't understand her
She didn't want to do what they planned for her to do
She came to write, to be like the other kids
Who do what they did until late at night

See the girl always laughing
When she's alone she cries
You'll see her smile and you'll feel the pressure of running
Running all the time

She didn't like the boredom of the classroom
All the things they taught her made no sense to her
Why stay inside when so much called her
Made her dream of being far away

See the girl always laughing
When she's alone she cries
You'll see her smile and you'll feel the pressure of running
Running all the time, all the time

You and beauty can't just stop the sin
From being a tragedy
And when you look a little closer you'll see what I mean
You'll see what I mean

Her Mom and Dad didn't even know her
Why do they expect to see her one more time
She made a point and everyone has felt it
Why did she have to, why did she do it at all

See the girl always laughing
When she's alone she cries
You'll see her smile and you'll feel the pressure of
You'll see her smile and you'll feel the pressure of
Running all the time, running all the time
Running all the time, running all the time

american song
Well I was in a place once
Where if you wanted something then you took it for yourself
Cause that was the way of doing things to keep the balance perfect
But I, I never did it

And I, I want what you got
And I don't ever want to share
'Cause it's capital and if you're poor, you've got yourself to blame
In such a righteous country

Just play an American song
Just play an American song

I'm never wrong
And I don't ever want to change
You know that I just want to live by standards high beyond my means
Of course, I won't admit it

Just play an American song
Just play an American song
Just play an American song
Just play an American song

I defend my family honor
And I'm not ashamed to tell you
That I don't care what happens to the rest of all the world
No I, I just pretend to

Just play an American song
Just play an American song
Just play an American song
Just play an American song
Just play an American song
Just play an American song
Just play an American song
Just play an American song
Just play an American song
Just play an American song
Just play an American song
Just play an American song

true love
If you hadn't have left me alone
I wouldn't be in such a state
If you'd stuck around just a bit
I'm sure you'd have seen things my way
All I have is your photograph at home
And you're miles and miles away
If I ever met up with you I'm sure
We'd be different as night and day

You think what's troubling me is just sentimentality, but you're wrong
I've never felt this way before about anybody else I've ever known before
And this true love is breaking my heart
Yeah, it's true, love is breaking my heart

How can I picture you now when you
Have been gone for such a long time
I must look silly to you now but still
I try and I try and I try

You think what's troubling me is just sentimentality, but you're wrong
I've never felt this way before about anyone else I've known before
And this true love is breaking my heart
Yeah, it's true, love is breaking my heart

You think what's troubling me is just sentimentality, but you're wrong
I've never felt this way before about anyone else I've known before
And this true love is breaking my heart
Yeah, it's true, love is breaking my heart
Yeah, it's true, love is breaking my heart
  

part of the noise
I've been up all night waiting for you to come home
It gets on my nerves and I don't know why you haven't phoned me
It's nearly four A. M.

Part of the noise, it's driving me crazy
The dark beats time with the rock n' roll tap
Your voice is music for me
But these noises are so frustrating

I just wanna go to sleep
I don't wanna worry about you and all of your problems
But I'm sorry
It's all just part of the noise to me, it's all just part of the noise to me

When I need a radiator dripping the tap
Baby, your sounding just like that

I've been up all night waiting for you to come home
It gets on my nerves and I don't know why you haven't phoned me
It's nearly four A. M.

Part of the noise, it's driving me crazy
The dark beats time with the rock n' roll tap
Your voice is music to me

But these noises are so frustrating
I just wanna go to sleep
I don't wanna worry about you and all of your problems
But I'm sorry
I just wanna go to sleep
I don't wanna worry about you and all of your problems
But I'm sorry
It's all just part of the noise to me, it's all just part of the noise to me
It's all just part of the noise to me, it's all just part of the noise to me
It's all just part of the noise to me, it's all just part of the noise to me
It's all just part of the noise to me, it's all just part of the noise to me
It's all just part of the noise to me, it's all just part of the noise to me
It's all just part of the noise to me, it's all just part of the noise to me
It's all just part of the noise to me, it's all just part of the noise to me
It's all just part of the noise to me, it's all just part of the noise to me

lies
Lies, all the things you told me
No base in truth, blatant fiction tales
Lies, obvious evasion
You're speaking words that don't mean a thing
When we are in the same room
You talk like I'm a fool
You think that I believe everything
When really, I don't believe anything
It's all lies, speaking in distortion
Well I have eyes and I'll see the truth
Lies, what you did to me
You're covering up what you want to hide
When I look into your face
I see the lips that lies have had

You think that I believe everything
When really, I don't believe anything
Lies, all the things you told me
No base in truth, blatant fiction tales
Lies, obvious evasion
You're speaking words that don't mean a thing
When we are in the same room
You talk like I'm a fool
You think that I believe everything
You think that I believe everything
You think that I believe everything
When really, I don't believe anything
It's all lies (lies)

i'm numb
I thought you really loved me
That's what you said and it surprised me when I found out that it wasn't so
Well I'm just another number
It wasn't worth a dime to call me and tell me, let me in on the news

You walked out (I feel numb)
You walked out (I looked dumb)
You walked out so don't come back no more

I talked to love eternal
And then I turned my back to find you burned me, burned me, traded me for someone new
I couldn't get too angry, I only felt frustration
I'm allergic to an unconditioned response

You walked out (I feel numb)
You walked out (I looked dumb)
You walked out so don't come back no more

I felt your feelings start to please me
And I felt your arms begin to squeeze me
You told me you'd never release me
I guess you made that up to freeze me

You walked out (I feel numb)
You walked out (I looked dumb)
You walked out so don't come back no more

You walked out (I feel numb)
You walked out (I looked dumb)
You walked out so don't come back no more

the witch
See you got a little girl
She's new in town

She's got long black hair
Big black car
I know what you're thinking

You better send them away (*howl*)
And now you know the score
I've made it clear
And do you remember
I told you so
She's gonna make you itch

Most of the people are sleeping tight
If you hear knocking on your door
You better send them away (*howl*)
Got a little girl

She might put you down now
She's gonna make you itch
Said she's the witch

She talked the way you do
Yeah, talked the way you do
She talked the way you do, the way you do
But it's not

Oh no, it's not

She kissed the way you do
Yeah, kissed the way you do
And I had this though
That she was really you
That she was really you
That she was really you
But it's not
Oh no, it's not
Oh no, it's not
No, it's not really you at all
No, no, no, no, no
But it's not
Oh no, it's not
Oh no, it's not
No it's not really you at all


America Commits Suicide
New faces, old news A new wind brings the old chills The idea isn’t dead They want the world They got the voice They’re gonna shout They got to let the pressure out
So let’s all watch while America commits suicide As America commits suicide As America commits suicide As America commits suicide
Nervous hands on the trigger sights Somebody’s dream is rotten inside Used to be so well respected Red shadows haunt them A red future taunts them But a new resistance might correct it
So let’s all watch while America commits suicide As America commits suicide As America commits suicide As America commits suicide
Two giants clash with words Two giants swell with pride Two giants shake their fists Two giants want to suicide
So what good do out fine ideas do us? We only use them for excuses Stupid fear struggles against thought You can imagine which one loses
So let’s all watch while America commits suicide As America commits suicide As America commits suicide As America commits suicide
Watch the USA commits suicide Russia commits suicide China commits suicide India commits suicide Cambodia commits suicide El Salvador commits suicide Canada commits suicide The whole world suicides
Behind the Smile
You and me, girl, we’ll fight it out against the world If she believes that, she’ll believe everything she’s told I’ll never leave you, not till the mountains turn to dust If he believes that, he’s got a little too much trust
She’s nothing to him He’s nothing to her And both of them are less than that to me They’ve both been had A lie behind the smile Perjuring to cultivate a dream
Businessmen and workers help each other make their way If you believe that, just look around and count your pay The government will help you, protect the old and feed the poor You might believe that, till the police are at your door You’re nothing to them They’re nothing to you And both of you are less than that to me The skull and the badge Are the lie behind the smile Used against the powerless and weak
I’m a hero, I’m the spokesman for the crowd My only claim to fame is a machine that makes me loud Where am I leading you, why can’t you get there on your own If you believe in me, someday I’ll leave you all alone
I’m nothing to you You’re nothing to me And less than nothing’s what I want to be Confusion and noise I’m sick behind my smile Sick of every face that I see I’m sick of every face that I see I’m sick of every face that I see
Big Picture
The factories have been looking for me They’ve been talking among themselves Trying to get me for their shelves There’s a nine-to-fiver slot empty for me It’s the best that they have got But it’s not right for me I don’t fit the big picture I don’t fit the big picture
The big structure has been trying to get me They’ve been trying every day to help me find my way Fill out these forms for us Do your best for us Cause all we want from you Is to tell you what to do I don’t fit the big picture I don’t fit the big picture
I don’t wanna play the game I don’t want be the same As all the people on the street Who always look so beat Who walk like every step Is the last one they may get
The factories have been looking for me They’ve been talking among themselves Trying to get me for their shelves Fill out these forms for us Do your best for us Cause all we want from you Is to tell you what to do
I don’t fit the big picture I don’t fit the big picture I don’t fit the big picture I won’t fit the big picture
Breaking Point
Looking for some inspiration on this grey street Looking for imagination on this grey street Even all the windows look tired out Even all the children are burnt out
Same people go walking by on this grey street Same old things are all they say, confessions of defeat A thousand different ways to say, “I give up” A thousand different reasons to give up
It takes time to sink in But it penetrates right through your skin As you reach the breaking point Breaking point Breaking point Breaking point At the breaking point
Can you feel the tension Can you feel it grind Have you seen it knock them down, petrify their minds? Bleeding from the wounds they give themselves Living for the pain they give themselves
It takes time to sink in But it penetrates right through your skin When you reach the breaking point Breaking point Breaking point At the breaking point
Can you feel the tension Can you feel the tension Can you feel the tension Can you feel the tension
At the breaking point At the breaking point At the breaking point At the breaking point
Canada's Favourite Sport
I’ve got my two-four in my trunk The roads are icy but I’m alright If I crash it don’t mean shit Cause if I don’t I’ll just fight all night
If I can run I’ll run into you Because I’m a brainless human blight On the road is my favourite sport To have another drunken night to Roll your hot car in the ditch That’s Canada’s favourite sport Drink until you’re mindless To be the same and think you’re great Learn to hate what the Nazi’s hate
Lungs black with nicotine Car stereo blasting Queen Burning rubber down the strip I know inside I’m the man that’s it
If I can run I’ll run into you Because I’m a brainless human blight On the road is my favourite sport To have another drunken night to Roll your hot car in the ditch That’s Canada’s favourite sport Drink until you’re mindless To be the same and think you’re great And learn to hate what the Nazi’s hate And pretend you don’t have a brain
I’ve got my two-four in my trunk The roads are icy but I’m alright If I crash it don’t mean shit Cause if I don’t I’ll just fight all night
If I can run I’ll run into you Because I’m a brainless human blight On the road is my favourite sport To have another drunken night to Roll your hot car in the ditch That’s Canada’s favourite sport Drink until you’re mindless To be the same and think you’re great Learn to hate what the Nazi’s hate And suck
Dead at Birth
They think they’re fucking smart today Actually they don’t have a thing to say Cause everyone stands around like they got no brain To look the part they think it’s smart
Well it’s in to be a rude boy clone If you don’t want to sleep alone Well who knows what the look will be next month I guess just London, England knows
And they’re all thoughtless parasites Nineteen-eighty punk disco-ites They were all dead when they were born
And they’re all thoughtless parasites Nineteen-eighty punk disco-ites They were all dead when they were born
They’re seen on Granville Street each day The Le Chateau has the clothes for which they pray They walk the streets, like they’re really tough They think they’re in, they think they’re punks
But they’re all thoughtless parasites Nineteen-eighty punk disco-ites They were all dead when they were born
And they’re all thoughtless parasites Nineteen eighty punk discoites They were all dead then they were born In this fashion craze
They think they’re fucking smart today Actually they don’t have a thing to say Cause everyone stands around like they got no brain To look the part they think it’s smart
And they’re all thoughtless parasites Nineteen-eighty punk disco-ites They were all dead when they were born
And they’re all thoughtless parasites Nineteen-eighty punk disco-ites They were all dead when they were born Dead at birth
Death to the Sickoids
Death must come to the sickoids at last Peace will become a thing of the past The sickoids have the armies and the guns in their grasp They’re going to destroy us with their threats and their lies We must kill them They bug me
They’re trying to frame the Red Brigades Tell us all we’re threatened by the terrorist plague They’re hanging a noose around our necks By gluing our minds to the front page Kill them You got no choice
Death to the sickoids, or death to you They got the money, they think they got the power To step on your face, make you lick their boots
Rise against them
They’re trying to frame the Red Brigades By telling us we’re threatened by a terrorist plague They’re hanging a noose around our necks By gluing our minds to the front page Kill them Rise against them
Death Was Too Kind
I knew from the moment that I looked at your face That you deserved to be sprayed with mace You lied and you bitched like a diseased rat I knew you were an obstacle in my path I thought of death but it was too kind You must have thought that I was blind
But I, I I wish that you would go eat shit Out, out Out of a giant garbage pit
You came my way on a dismal day I wish that you would go away And when you said you were my friend I knew to you I had to put an end I thought of tortures, death and pain But then I found out you had no brain
And I, I I wish that you would go eat shit Out, out Out of a giant garbage pit You came into my house and you wouldn’t leave You had a trick up your sleeve And then you took away my friend And to his life you put an end You’re just a bitch, a public bore And nobody’s got no respect for you
And I, I I wish that you would go eat shit Out, out Out of a giant garbage pit
And I, I I wish that you would go eat shit Out, out Out of a giant garbage pit
Firing Squad
I had a firing squad dream, I saw it all clearly I heard the headless people scream, I saw it all clearly I saw the holy man Blood on his holy hands I saw the justice of god
Police and priests and prophets all in one The new order soldiers taking aim on holy orders People bowing at the call Rebels standing at the wall It’s called the justice of god
I saw their justice I saw the word of god I saw their mercy It was the firing squad
Innocent and guilty behind bars, locked up together Madness and confusion of this kind could last forever The minister of execution Calls for a retribution Calls for the justice of god
Crowds of disciples running wild, under control While desperate people hide inside, wait to explode Another week, another year, who knows who’ll feel the fear Who’ll feel the justice of god
I saw their justice I saw the word of god I saw their mercy It was the firing squad
I saw their justice I saw the word of god I saw their mercy It was the firing squad
It was the firing squad It was the firing squad It was the firing squad It was the firing squad
For the Common Good
There’s no need for any of you to leave your homes “It’s only radiation,” was lightly broadcast across the nation So there are some details that might have slipped our mind Our sacrifices for you, well they keep us very busy They say it’s for the common good Some sacrifices by us all
Oh, yes, we’ve built your house on a chemical dump site but baby don’t you worry There’s more people where you came from Yeah, there’s some details that slipped our mind Well helping out the public keeps us very busy They say it’s for the common good If there are some things we are’t told We don’t know
Keep churning missiles out, three more each day Creating our protection for our imminent destruction Then even if we all die we can still strike back And even when you’re dead well you’ll know we got the bastards Cause they say it’s for the common good If we destroy the entire place Yeah it’s for the common good If there are some things we aren’t told They say it’s for the common good Sacrifices by us all Like the earth

Fuck You
You call us weirdos, you call us crazy Say we’re evil, say we’re lazy Say we’re just the violent type Kind of dumb, not too bright
We don’t care what you say Fuck you We don’t care what you say Fuck you
You tell your friends that we’re really sick Just short-haired fags on a commie trip And you should know cause you’re so cool Number one, nobody’s fool
We don’t care what you say Fuck you We don’t care what you say Fuck you Suck a big one
We don’t care what you say Fuck you We don’t care what you say Fuck you
Well come on man you better jump right in Thus is one game you don’t gotta win Don’t care where you’ve been, don’t care how you look It’s hellfire man, you’re in you gotta cook
We don’t care what you say Fuck you We don’t care what you say We don’t care what you say We don’t care what you say Fuck you
Googolplex
Well it’s that time again, but nothing drastic’s changed Our days just tick on by without a change The fat and lazy public would rather watch things die Than get up from their armchairs where eventually they’re going to die
It’s the way of the human race To let their empires crash down in their face
Who’s never seen is never clearly felt The whales slaughtered, seals cry for help The tragedy of extinction, of slaughter inhumane Our senses overloaded by all the world’s pain So everybody hides their heads
It’s the way of the human race To let their empires crash down in their face While they read it in the papers And they wallow in their garbage pit
Well it’s that time again, but nothing drastic’s changed Our days just tick on by without a change The fat and lazy public would rather watch things die Than get up from their armchairs where eventually they’re going to die
Because It’s the way of the human race To let their empires crash down in their face It’s the way of the human race To let empires crash down in their face
It’s the way of the human race It’s the way of the human race It’s the way of the human race To lay sitting in their armchairs wallowing in their waste Until you rot
Greaser Boy
You move around the party, walking tall You’ve gotta prove that you’re a man You grin and flex your muscles, strut your stuff Show off your tattoos and your tan
Greaser boy, what’s wrong with you What makes you do the things you do Greaser boy, why can’t you see You are own worst enemy
You single out a victim, a sacrifice For your macho mentality You do him in and leave him in agony Another senseless casualty
Greaser boy, what’s wrong with you What makes you do the things you do Greaser boy, why can’t you see You are own worst enemy
Greaser boy, what’s wrong with you What makes you do the things you do Greaser boy, why can’t you see You are own worst enemy
You brag about your actions, spew verbal shit You think you’re much too big to fall But if by chance it happens and you’re alone Who’s going to answer when you call
Greaser boy, what’s wrong with you What makes you do the things you do Greaser boy, why can’t you see You are own worst enemy
Greaser boy Greaser boy Greaser boy Greaser boy Greaser boy Greaser boy Greaser boy Greaser boy

Helicopter
Some noise in the night, everything’s going fine, doing nothing wrong A little bit bored, just hanging out, nothing going on Wait a minute, what’s that coming at us Chopper sliding in over billboards and rooftops Just what the fuck’s going on?
Out in the back with a cold six-pack, just hanging out Shouts from inside, chairs smashing through glass, stark panic breaks out Wait a minute, what’s that coming at us Pinned by the spotlight, shit we’re surrounded Now there’s a riot going on
They got the overview Over me and you They always know somehow I think they’re coming now I think they’re coming now They’re coming now
Can’t stay get away they win today, it was never in doubt Cars and guns and riot clubs, they all need a work out They’ve got the power and they’re gonna remind you Run down the street and they’re running right behind you Is there a war going on?
Hiroshima
There’s nothing left to argue Talks have broken down No official statements Strange rumours going round Last night at sunset Jet trails in the sky Someone going somewhere But no one saying why
Hiroshima No one wants to save you Hiroshima No one wants to save you
The newsman had a stutter He was sweating pretty bad And then he faded out of sight What was it that he said?
Hiroshima No one wants to save you Hiroshima No one wants to save you Save you, save you
I couldn’t look around I couldn’t turn my head Something that was coming Filled me up with dread I heard a noise I couldn’t understand Something just arriving Something close at hand
Hiroshima No one wants to save you Hiroshima No one wants to save you
Hiroshima No one wants to save you Save you Save you
Inquisition Day
Don’t be surprised if they kick down your door And shoot your life apart It’s nothing new it’s happened before And nothing’s gonna stop it when it starts
Run and hide Once out in the open you know it’s too late And you’re wasting all your time Very soon there will be nowhere left to hide
Don’t be surprised if they close down the schools And take the children away And don’t be suprised if the unions fall And there’s an inquisition day Don’t be surprised if your education Won’t buy you safety and peace It’s gonna be painful when you realize You’re not immune to the fascist disease
Run and hide Once out in the open you know it’s too late And you’re wasting all your time Very soon there will be nowhere left to hide Don’t be surprised if they kick down your door And shoot your life apart It’s nothing new it’s happened before And nothing’s gonna stop it when it starts
Run and hide Once out in the open you know it’s too late And you’re wasting all your time There’s nowhere you can go now
Run and hide Once out in the open you know it’s too late And you’re wasting all your time Very soon there will be nowhere left to hide
Let’s Go Down to Hollywood (and Shoot People)
Computerized surroundings in a sterilized room Pressured behaviour twists your rented-out mind Uneasiness starts to grind Once-satiated instincts search for release A claustrophobic feeling sits in your gut To be primitive man
Nightclub cowboy, cut your masquerade Face up to your life
A strange desire leads you down to the store Horses and six-guns race through your head The redneck fever spreads New cowboy boots sit tough on your feet Suede leather jacket and a ten-gallon hat Now you’re a real man
Nightclub cowboy, cut your masquerade Face up to your life Midnight cowboy, play your new-look role Masturbate your mind And you will find
Nothing’s really changed You’re just as messed-up if not more It’s not a fad that’s gonna help you You’re just as trapped as you were before
Your stupid customs really seem like a thrill Another chance to practice wasting your time The newest human decline Old chauvinisms can resurface again Step on the progress that’s been made in the past Keep running from yourself And keep fucking everybody else
Nightclub cowboy, cut your masquerade Face up to your life Midnight cowboy, play your new-look role Masturbate your mind And you will find
Nothing’s really changed You’re just as messed-up if not more It’s not a fad that’s gonna help you You’re just as trapped as you were before You’re just as trapped as you were before You’re just as trapped as you were before You’re just as trapped as you were before Another chance to waste your time Another chance to waste your time Another chance to waste your time
Mobile Electric Chair
I finally heard of a job for me A useful job that serves the community Guaranteed fun without a care To drive the Mobile Electric Chair
That would be a real job for me To retain my formal dignity I want it now Yeah, I want it for me A good job with security I want it now Yeah, I want it for me Cheap thrills and electricity
Even if I could only strap them in I’d teach the bastards to regret their sins Well, there at the place where they commit their crimes To drag their bodies out when they’ve been fried
That would be a real job for me To retain my formal dignity Oh yeah, oh yeah baby I want it now Yeah, I want it for me A good job with security I want it now Yeah, I want it for me Cheap thrills with electricity
Then to really put fear in their ass A mobile courtroom sets up on the grass They have the trial on the day of the crime American justice to deal with slime
That would be a real job for me To retain my formal dignity I want it now Yeah, I want it for me A good job with security I want it now Yeah, I want it for me Cheap thrills and electricity I want it now
Model of Stupidity
Well, don’t ask me to give you the time of day If you were smart you’d just stay away I’ve got a pile of shit for jerks like you I like to smash heads black and blue
So grab a brain You give me a pain, you know Why don’t you grab a brain A slug’s got more brains than you
You are the model of stupidity Don’t know a thing about reality I’ve got a pile of shit for jerks like you I’d like to smash heads black and blue
So grab a brain You ain’t got much time, you know Why don’t you grab a brain You give me a pain you know
An avant-garde socialite Or just a neuraloid hypocrite You’re just a fuck-up by another name A parasite in a human’s brain
So grab a brain You give me a pain, you know Why don’t you grab a brain You ain’t got much time, you know
Moron Majority
A coldness spreads across the nation People claim that it’s what they want Cause then at least they can say they made it That they were on the side that won As we go wallowing in apathy
The stench spreads across the nation But people plug their noses well And claim that their distractions are all real An ostrich mind in the structured cell
As we go wallowing in apathy, yeah we’re wallowing in apathy Now we’re ruled by the moral moron majority With their closed, backward minds Spouting all their sacred brainwashed lies We got the, the bigots push for world destruction Run and smash, we can change today
Religious phobics twisting psalms to destruction As preaching liars attempt to twist our minds We celebrate a new aggressive transition A unity in death with the lord’s design
As we go wallowing in apathy, as we wallow in our apathy Now we’re ruled by the moral moron majority With their closed, backward minds Spouting all their sacred brainwashed lies We got the, the bigots push for world destruction Must burn and smash and we can change today Oh yeah Yeah
New Order
Old ways cannon and imperial flag, white hands so huge Now aircraft carrier diplomats, white lands so few European guns in the villages, wealth bought with pain Now western power diminishes, never come again
It’s the boot stamping of the reckoning coming It’s the tank growling of the dread army coming
Many lands poor few lands rich, feel hunger pressure Balance is trembling it’s gonna flip, force without measure Demonstrate and educate, soon get imitation Soon the modern war machines in every nation
It’s the boot stamping of the reckoning coming It’s the tank growling of the dread army coming It’s the loud crashing of the dead order crumbling It’s the jet howling of the dread army coming
People rise from years of sleep, new oil power Old ways gone, no time left, soon be new hour But I grow older very day, count out my time If the crash don’t come till I’m out of the way, well I won’t mind
It’s the boot stamping of the reckoning coming It’s the tank growling of the dread army coming It’s the loud crashing of the dead order crumbling It’s the jet howling of the dread army coming
No Productivity
Got no time to kill, you got nothing to do Slow on productivity cause nothing is new Music is a mockery, words mean less Silence and destruction, a bloody mess
No productivity Forced negativity Constant anxiety Dead end society
Standing in an alley on a Saturday night Well if I wasn’t hammered it wouldn’t be right Waiting for the enemy to make their move Feeling like a target in an arcade booth
No productivity Forced negativity Constant anxiety Dead end society
You stagger home to bed at a quarter past two Stoned out of your head on acid and glue You can’t tell your parents what it is that you do You don’t dig the opening you’re forced to go through No productivity Forced negativity Constant anxiety Dead end society No productivity
No Wishes, No Prayers
You’ve got control of your own destiny No wishes, no prayers It’s got to be your own responsibility
No invisible guardians No wishes, no prayers You’ve got to dig your head out from the bloody sand
One by one in the street Realizing they don’t want defeat They shout defiance at the ritual sheep
A million wars in the name of some god No wishes, no prayers Superstition wastes the dawning of a better day
Missionaries teaching god to the savage mind No wishes, no prayers So now they know to hate satan and live a life of fear
One by one in the street Realizing they don’t want defeat They shout defiance at the ritual sheep
Learning to see just what’s right For some sanity they now must fight Once you’ve seen what could be, there’s no turning back There’s no turning back Once you’ve seen what could be, there’s no turning back
A new idea finally sees its time No wishes, no prayers Still attached to the blackmailers of yesterday
Now the question is a race against time No wishes, no prayers To fight the ignorance that’s in our way
One by one in the street Realizing they don’t want defeat They shout defiance at the ritual sheep
Learning to see just what’s right For some sanity they now must fight Once you’ve seen what could be, there’s no turning back
No wishes, no prayers No wishes, no prayers No wishes, no prayers No wishes, no prayers
Oh Canaduh
Every new day the dollar goes down The sea’s getting blacker, the sky’s turning brown You ain’t got a job, you can’t pay the rent And now you’re paying interest on all the money you’ve been lent
Oh Canaduh What’s wrong with you You better wake up Now what you gonna do
The big companies are milking us dry Our corporation nation is soon gonna die And in the capitol they’re sipping their tea They care about their paycheques but not about you and me
Oh Canaduh What’s wrong with you You better wake up Now what you gonna do
You spent all your money on a lot of useless toys You’re so fucking dumb you stupid cowboys You ain’t got no jobs, you can’t pay the rent And now we’re paying interest on all the money you’ve been lent
Oh Canaduh What’s wrong with you You better wake up Now what you gonna do
White wasteland
Out of Line
My parents told me to go to school My teachers told me the golden rule The rules told me just be cool I’m not going to play their fucking fool
Shut up your mouth Shut up your eyes Shut down your brain Don’t step out of line, they’ll show you’re insane
Don’t tell me what to do I don’t need you Don’t tell me what to see You’re nothing to me
Dropped out of school, forgot what they said Don’t follow rules, words that are dead On the run from the thought patrol Witht their destruction the final goal
Open your mouth Open your eyes Open your brain Step out of line, show you’re insane
Refugee
It seems like human hands are made to hurt It seems like human hearts are made of dirt They’ll hurt you every time, and you don’t know why If you can’t learn to hold on tight, learn to say goodbye
Isn’t it clear you’re not wanted here Isn’t it clear you’re not wanted here
Every time you look around, something’s going wrong The good things dry up overnight, the bad go on and on You’re not crazy, you’re seeing it right, that’s reality You never get the things you want, except in fantasy
Isn’t it clear you’re not wanted here Isn’t it clear you’re not wanted here You’ve got your orders, refugee You’ve got your orders, refugee You’ve got your orders, refugee You’ve got your orders, refugee
Isn’t it clear you’re not wanted here Isn’t it clear you’re not wanted here
Isn’t it clear you’re not wanted here Isn’t it clear you’re not wanted here
You’ve got your orders, refugee You’ve got your orders, refugee You’ve got your orders, refugee You’ve got your orders, refugee
You’ve got your orders, refugee You’re not wanted here
Slap in the Face
I want to see some getting back to reality No more punk posturing, you may as well build ICBMs No more nine to five, cause this society is in a dive And if you play the rules, you may as well just pack it in
Can’t you see what has happened to us, left on our own Waiting for rebellion coming down tomorrow, waiting to be shown
The music spoke our thoughts until it fell to the money men They bought it cheap and made us all look like fools again Another slap in the face and then the people who demanded change Were pushed aside by faddist wimps dancing to new wave
Now once again they’ve drawn the line They don’t need you anyway We better wring their bloody necks this time Oh yeah, oh yeah
I want to see some getting back to reality No more punk posturing, you may as well build ICBMs No more nine to five, cause this society is in a dive And if you play the rules, you may as well just pack it in
Can’t you see what has happened to us, left on our own Waiting for rebellion coming down tomorrow, waiting to be shown
Can’t you see what has happened to us, left on our own Waiting for rebellion coming down tomorrow, waiting to be shown Not by you
Slave to My Dick
I put on my clothes that make me look tall I don’t think about it, cause I don’t think at all I dress high class, makes me look high paid You know I do it baby cause I wanta get laid I’m just a slave to my dick It really makes me sick
I lie to myself and to my friends too And if I want your girl I’ll lie to you too I’ll play stupid games, do whatever it takes Cause I’ve gotta have a ball and the time’s getting late I’m just a slave to my dick It really makes me sick
I live in the bars, I live in the pubs My mind is a blank from drinking in the clubs I do a lot of talking but I don’t say much I can’t be real cause I’m such, you know I’m such a Slave to my dick It really makes me sick
Slave to my dick Slave to my dick Slave to my dick Slave to my dick
The Scheme
They said that we can’t Play for the big man We were too outspoken They think that they can choke us out Rip off the punks The big promoters rake the grands One hundred and fifty bucks Is all the assholes pay the bands
I can’t stand the new regime Commercial rock, new wave pop Mindless music I’ve seen through the scheme I won’t suck for success What’s the point of songs about pointless trash
And they wonder why That all the punks are mad Why don’t we grow up And play their game Well if you don’t know I guess that’s cool But if you think we’re jerks Then you’re a bloody fool
I can’t stand the new regime Commercial rock, new wave pop Mindless music I’ve seen through the scheme I won’t suck for success What’s the point of songs about pointless trash
I can’t stand the new regime Commercial rock, new wave pop Mindless music I’ve seen through the scheme I won’t suck for success What’s the point of songs about pointless trash
And they wonder why That all the punks are mad Why don’t we grow up And play their game Well if you don’t know I guess that’s cool But if you think we’re jerks Then you’re a bloody fool
Urban Guerrillas
Positive emotion means negative action So cause a commotion and love the reaction Negative thoughts clear your head Eloquent logic says you’d be better off dead
Guerrillas, urban guerrillas Living in an urban zoo Guerrillas, urban guerrillas Point the way for me and you
Ridiculous charges, men on the run Explosions at midnight, the barrels of guns Roadblocks are funny, gelignite’s neat People are nothing but unslaughtered meat
Guerrillas, urban guerrillas Living in an urban zoo Guerrillas, urban guerrillas Point the way for me and you
Cryptic letters in newspaper type The mysteries of death, the power of knives Cool on the corner, hope nobody’s looking Watch over your shoulder, watch out for what’s cooking
Guerrillas, urban guerrillas Living in an urban zoo Guerrillas, urban guerrillas Point the way for me and you
War in the Head
He can’t seem to find the trouble he’s been looking for He gets police action when he wants world war He has lifeless days he can barely get through He waits and waits and waits for something new
War in the head He wants to move it outside War in the head He has to move it outside
He says that lies are crimes but he doesn’t believe it They’re just another tool to use What’s wrong with him? He can’t affect anything He shoves and pushes but nothing ever moves
War in the head He wants to move it outside War in the head He has to move it outside
Everyone he knows found a protective hole He can’t see his but he knows it’s there He says that things have to change for the better He wishes things would change anyway at all
War in the head He wants to move it outside War in the head He has to move it outside
War in the head War in the head War in the head War in the head War in the head War in the head

We’re Alive
Again we’re in the news, again it’s all a lie They wish we’d go away, they wish that we would die You never know the reason cause you only saw the fad You never heard us play but you’re sure we’re really bad
You ain’t worth shit but I’m still going to warn you We’re alive Better keep an eye over your shoulder We’re alive
They say it ain’t conspiracy but I don’t know See money calls the shots, so money’s got to go Musical monopoly is really a drag You think you picked the stars so the rest you’re gonna slag
You ain’t worth shit but I’m still going to warn you We’re alive Better keep an eye over your shoulder We’re alive
You think up here in Lotus Land we’re really having fun I’m waiting for my welfare but it may never come Well just remember when you jerk yourself in bed Our job will never be done till every dog is dead
We’re alive Better keep an eye over your shoulder We’re alive We’re alive We’re alive We’re alive


automan
Don’t wanna be left out Thinking’ for myself I wanna be part of it all My brain on the shelf I wanna have a job Work for someone else
I will be your automan
Don’t wanna be left out I wanna be normal I wanna wear the same clothes As everybody else No more second hand So you can see what I am
I will be your automan I will do anything you want
Shove a quarter in the slot And you will understand I will be your automan
I wanna sell your product Whatever it may be I wanna new car Like the ones that I see I wanna eat right Bone dry and squeaky clean
I will be your automan
Don’t wanna be left out I’ll get a good rating Ten of fifteen credit cards Computerized lady A nuclear kitchen Robots at the mall
I will be your automan I will do anything you want
Shove a quarter in the slot You will understand I will be your automan
I wanna eat your product I want it wall to wall Renewable prescriptions My Doctor on call I wanna be sick I wanna relax
I will be your automan I will be your automan I will be your automan

WELL, WELL, WELL
Well, well, well I don’t have too much to say About the people I step over On my way to work Each and every day
I watch the group up the street The great unwashed They really bug me Yeah, they really bug me
I got a job I work in a bank Near Hastings and Main Cashing cheques for the slaves
And then they walk up the street Give their money back to me The Bank of BC The Bank of BC
Well, I don’t care I’m just in training For a manager’s shift In the Central Interior
Some sticky little town With a Chinese teller (??) I think I’m gonna tell her All the things I’m gonna tell her
