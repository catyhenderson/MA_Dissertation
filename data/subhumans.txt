America Commits Suicide
New faces, old news A new wind brings the old chills The idea isn’t dead They want the world They got the voice They’re gonna shout They got to let the pressure out
So let’s all watch while America commits suicide As America commits suicide As America commits suicide As America commits suicide
Nervous hands on the trigger sights Somebody’s dream is rotten inside Used to be so well respected Red shadows haunt them A red future taunts them But a new resistance might correct it
So let’s all watch while America commits suicide As America commits suicide As America commits suicide As America commits suicide
Two giants clash with words Two giants swell with pride Two giants shake their fists Two giants want to suicide
So what good do out fine ideas do us? We only use them for excuses Stupid fear struggles against thought You can imagine which one loses
So let’s all watch while America commits suicide As America commits suicide As America commits suicide As America commits suicide
Watch the USA commits suicide Russia commits suicide China commits suicide India commits suicide Cambodia commits suicide El Salvador commits suicide Canada commits suicide The whole world suicides
Behind the Smile
You and me, girl, we’ll fight it out against the world If she believes that, she’ll believe everything she’s told I’ll never leave you, not till the mountains turn to dust If he believes that, he’s got a little too much trust
She’s nothing to him He’s nothing to her And both of them are less than that to me They’ve both been had A lie behind the smile Perjuring to cultivate a dream
Businessmen and workers help each other make their way If you believe that, just look around and count your pay The government will help you, protect the old and feed the poor You might believe that, till the police are at your door You’re nothing to them They’re nothing to you And both of you are less than that to me The skull and the badge Are the lie behind the smile Used against the powerless and weak
I’m a hero, I’m the spokesman for the crowd My only claim to fame is a machine that makes me loud Where am I leading you, why can’t you get there on your own If you believe in me, someday I’ll leave you all alone
I’m nothing to you You’re nothing to me And less than nothing’s what I want to be Confusion and noise I’m sick behind my smile Sick of every face that I see I’m sick of every face that I see I’m sick of every face that I see
Big Picture
The factories have been looking for me They’ve been talking among themselves Trying to get me for their shelves There’s a nine-to-fiver slot empty for me It’s the best that they have got But it’s not right for me I don’t fit the big picture I don’t fit the big picture
The big structure has been trying to get me They’ve been trying every day to help me find my way Fill out these forms for us Do your best for us Cause all we want from you Is to tell you what to do I don’t fit the big picture I don’t fit the big picture
I don’t wanna play the game I don’t want be the same As all the people on the street Who always look so beat Who walk like every step Is the last one they may get
The factories have been looking for me They’ve been talking among themselves Trying to get me for their shelves Fill out these forms for us Do your best for us Cause all we want from you Is to tell you what to do
I don’t fit the big picture I don’t fit the big picture I don’t fit the big picture I won’t fit the big picture
Breaking Point
Looking for some inspiration on this grey street Looking for imagination on this grey street Even all the windows look tired out Even all the children are burnt out
Same people go walking by on this grey street Same old things are all they say, confessions of defeat A thousand different ways to say, “I give up” A thousand different reasons to give up
It takes time to sink in But it penetrates right through your skin As you reach the breaking point Breaking point Breaking point Breaking point At the breaking point
Can you feel the tension Can you feel it grind Have you seen it knock them down, petrify their minds? Bleeding from the wounds they give themselves Living for the pain they give themselves
It takes time to sink in But it penetrates right through your skin When you reach the breaking point Breaking point Breaking point At the breaking point
Can you feel the tension Can you feel the tension Can you feel the tension Can you feel the tension
At the breaking point At the breaking point At the breaking point At the breaking point
Canada's Favourite Sport
I’ve got my two-four in my trunk The roads are icy but I’m alright If I crash it don’t mean shit Cause if I don’t I’ll just fight all night
If I can run I’ll run into you Because I’m a brainless human blight On the road is my favourite sport To have another drunken night to Roll your hot car in the ditch That’s Canada’s favourite sport Drink until you’re mindless To be the same and think you’re great Learn to hate what the Nazi’s hate
Lungs black with nicotine Car stereo blasting Queen Burning rubber down the strip I know inside I’m the man that’s it
If I can run I’ll run into you Because I’m a brainless human blight On the road is my favourite sport To have another drunken night to Roll your hot car in the ditch That’s Canada’s favourite sport Drink until you’re mindless To be the same and think you’re great And learn to hate what the Nazi’s hate And pretend you don’t have a brain
I’ve got my two-four in my trunk The roads are icy but I’m alright If I crash it don’t mean shit Cause if I don’t I’ll just fight all night
If I can run I’ll run into you Because I’m a brainless human blight On the road is my favourite sport To have another drunken night to Roll your hot car in the ditch That’s Canada’s favourite sport Drink until you’re mindless To be the same and think you’re great Learn to hate what the Nazi’s hate And suck
Dead at Birth
They think they’re fucking smart today Actually they don’t have a thing to say Cause everyone stands around like they got no brain To look the part they think it’s smart
Well it’s in to be a rude boy clone If you don’t want to sleep alone Well who knows what the look will be next month I guess just London, England knows
And they’re all thoughtless parasites Nineteen-eighty punk disco-ites They were all dead when they were born
And they’re all thoughtless parasites Nineteen-eighty punk disco-ites They were all dead when they were born
They’re seen on Granville Street each day The Le Chateau has the clothes for which they pray They walk the streets, like they’re really tough They think they’re in, they think they’re punks
But they’re all thoughtless parasites Nineteen-eighty punk disco-ites They were all dead when they were born
And they’re all thoughtless parasites Nineteen eighty punk discoites They were all dead then they were born In this fashion craze
They think they’re fucking smart today Actually they don’t have a thing to say Cause everyone stands around like they got no brain To look the part they think it’s smart
And they’re all thoughtless parasites Nineteen-eighty punk disco-ites They were all dead when they were born
And they’re all thoughtless parasites Nineteen-eighty punk disco-ites They were all dead when they were born Dead at birth
Death to the Sickoids
Death must come to the sickoids at last Peace will become a thing of the past The sickoids have the armies and the guns in their grasp They’re going to destroy us with their threats and their lies We must kill them They bug me
They’re trying to frame the Red Brigades Tell us all we’re threatened by the terrorist plague They’re hanging a noose around our necks By gluing our minds to the front page Kill them You got no choice
Death to the sickoids, or death to you They got the money, they think they got the power To step on your face, make you lick their boots
Rise against them
They’re trying to frame the Red Brigades By telling us we’re threatened by a terrorist plague They’re hanging a noose around our necks By gluing our minds to the front page Kill them Rise against them
Death Was Too Kind
I knew from the moment that I looked at your face That you deserved to be sprayed with mace You lied and you bitched like a diseased rat I knew you were an obstacle in my path I thought of death but it was too kind You must have thought that I was blind
But I, I I wish that you would go eat shit Out, out Out of a giant garbage pit
You came my way on a dismal day I wish that you would go away And when you said you were my friend I knew to you I had to put an end I thought of tortures, death and pain But then I found out you had no brain
And I, I I wish that you would go eat shit Out, out Out of a giant garbage pit You came into my house and you wouldn’t leave You had a trick up your sleeve And then you took away my friend And to his life you put an end You’re just a bitch, a public bore And nobody’s got no respect for you
And I, I I wish that you would go eat shit Out, out Out of a giant garbage pit
And I, I I wish that you would go eat shit Out, out Out of a giant garbage pit
Firing Squad
I had a firing squad dream, I saw it all clearly I heard the headless people scream, I saw it all clearly I saw the holy man Blood on his holy hands I saw the justice of god
Police and priests and prophets all in one The new order soldiers taking aim on holy orders People bowing at the call Rebels standing at the wall It’s called the justice of god
I saw their justice I saw the word of god I saw their mercy It was the firing squad
Innocent and guilty behind bars, locked up together Madness and confusion of this kind could last forever The minister of execution Calls for a retribution Calls for the justice of god
Crowds of disciples running wild, under control While desperate people hide inside, wait to explode Another week, another year, who knows who’ll feel the fear Who’ll feel the justice of god
I saw their justice I saw the word of god I saw their mercy It was the firing squad
I saw their justice I saw the word of god I saw their mercy It was the firing squad
It was the firing squad It was the firing squad It was the firing squad It was the firing squad
For the Common Good
There’s no need for any of you to leave your homes “It’s only radiation,” was lightly broadcast across the nation So there are some details that might have slipped our mind Our sacrifices for you, well they keep us very busy They say it’s for the common good Some sacrifices by us all
Oh, yes, we’ve built your house on a chemical dump site but baby don’t you worry There’s more people where you came from Yeah, there’s some details that slipped our mind Well helping out the public keeps us very busy They say it’s for the common good If there are some things we are’t told We don’t know
Keep churning missiles out, three more each day Creating our protection for our imminent destruction Then even if we all die we can still strike back And even when you’re dead well you’ll know we got the bastards Cause they say it’s for the common good If we destroy the entire place Yeah it’s for the common good If there are some things we aren’t told They say it’s for the common good Sacrifices by us all Like the earth

Fuck You
You call us weirdos, you call us crazy Say we’re evil, say we’re lazy Say we’re just the violent type Kind of dumb, not too bright
We don’t care what you say Fuck you We don’t care what you say Fuck you
You tell your friends that we’re really sick Just short-haired fags on a commie trip And you should know cause you’re so cool Number one, nobody’s fool
We don’t care what you say Fuck you We don’t care what you say Fuck you Suck a big one
We don’t care what you say Fuck you We don’t care what you say Fuck you
Well come on man you better jump right in Thus is one game you don’t gotta win Don’t care where you’ve been, don’t care how you look It’s hellfire man, you’re in you gotta cook
We don’t care what you say Fuck you We don’t care what you say We don’t care what you say We don’t care what you say Fuck you
Googolplex
Well it’s that time again, but nothing drastic’s changed Our days just tick on by without a change The fat and lazy public would rather watch things die Than get up from their armchairs where eventually they’re going to die
It’s the way of the human race To let their empires crash down in their face
Who’s never seen is never clearly felt The whales slaughtered, seals cry for help The tragedy of extinction, of slaughter inhumane Our senses overloaded by all the world’s pain So everybody hides their heads
It’s the way of the human race To let their empires crash down in their face While they read it in the papers And they wallow in their garbage pit
Well it’s that time again, but nothing drastic’s changed Our days just tick on by without a change The fat and lazy public would rather watch things die Than get up from their armchairs where eventually they’re going to die
Because It’s the way of the human race To let their empires crash down in their face It’s the way of the human race To let empires crash down in their face
It’s the way of the human race It’s the way of the human race It’s the way of the human race To lay sitting in their armchairs wallowing in their waste Until you rot
Greaser Boy
You move around the party, walking tall You’ve gotta prove that you’re a man You grin and flex your muscles, strut your stuff Show off your tattoos and your tan
Greaser boy, what’s wrong with you What makes you do the things you do Greaser boy, why can’t you see You are own worst enemy
You single out a victim, a sacrifice For your macho mentality You do him in and leave him in agony Another senseless casualty
Greaser boy, what’s wrong with you What makes you do the things you do Greaser boy, why can’t you see You are own worst enemy
Greaser boy, what’s wrong with you What makes you do the things you do Greaser boy, why can’t you see You are own worst enemy
You brag about your actions, spew verbal shit You think you’re much too big to fall But if by chance it happens and you’re alone Who’s going to answer when you call
Greaser boy, what’s wrong with you What makes you do the things you do Greaser boy, why can’t you see You are own worst enemy
Greaser boy Greaser boy Greaser boy Greaser boy Greaser boy Greaser boy Greaser boy Greaser boy

Helicopter
Some noise in the night, everything’s going fine, doing nothing wrong A little bit bored, just hanging out, nothing going on Wait a minute, what’s that coming at us Chopper sliding in over billboards and rooftops Just what the fuck’s going on?
Out in the back with a cold six-pack, just hanging out Shouts from inside, chairs smashing through glass, stark panic breaks out Wait a minute, what’s that coming at us Pinned by the spotlight, shit we’re surrounded Now there’s a riot going on
They got the overview Over me and you They always know somehow I think they’re coming now I think they’re coming now They’re coming now
Can’t stay get away they win today, it was never in doubt Cars and guns and riot clubs, they all need a work out They’ve got the power and they’re gonna remind you Run down the street and they’re running right behind you Is there a war going on?
Hiroshima
There’s nothing left to argue Talks have broken down No official statements Strange rumours going round Last night at sunset Jet trails in the sky Someone going somewhere But no one saying why
Hiroshima No one wants to save you Hiroshima No one wants to save you
The newsman had a stutter He was sweating pretty bad And then he faded out of sight What was it that he said?
Hiroshima No one wants to save you Hiroshima No one wants to save you Save you, save you
I couldn’t look around I couldn’t turn my head Something that was coming Filled me up with dread I heard a noise I couldn’t understand Something just arriving Something close at hand
Hiroshima No one wants to save you Hiroshima No one wants to save you
Hiroshima No one wants to save you Save you Save you
Inquisition Day
Don’t be surprised if they kick down your door And shoot your life apart It’s nothing new it’s happened before And nothing’s gonna stop it when it starts
Run and hide Once out in the open you know it’s too late And you’re wasting all your time Very soon there will be nowhere left to hide
Don’t be surprised if they close down the schools And take the children away And don’t be suprised if the unions fall And there’s an inquisition day Don’t be surprised if your education Won’t buy you safety and peace It’s gonna be painful when you realize You’re not immune to the fascist disease
Run and hide Once out in the open you know it’s too late And you’re wasting all your time Very soon there will be nowhere left to hide Don’t be surprised if they kick down your door And shoot your life apart It’s nothing new it’s happened before And nothing’s gonna stop it when it starts
Run and hide Once out in the open you know it’s too late And you’re wasting all your time There’s nowhere you can go now
Run and hide Once out in the open you know it’s too late And you’re wasting all your time Very soon there will be nowhere left to hide
Let’s Go Down to Hollywood (and Shoot People)
Computerized surroundings in a sterilized room Pressured behaviour twists your rented-out mind Uneasiness starts to grind Once-satiated instincts search for release A claustrophobic feeling sits in your gut To be primitive man
Nightclub cowboy, cut your masquerade Face up to your life
A strange desire leads you down to the store Horses and six-guns race through your head The redneck fever spreads New cowboy boots sit tough on your feet Suede leather jacket and a ten-gallon hat Now you’re a real man
Nightclub cowboy, cut your masquerade Face up to your life Midnight cowboy, play your new-look role Masturbate your mind And you will find
Nothing’s really changed You’re just as messed-up if not more It’s not a fad that’s gonna help you You’re just as trapped as you were before
Your stupid customs really seem like a thrill Another chance to practice wasting your time The newest human decline Old chauvinisms can resurface again Step on the progress that’s been made in the past Keep running from yourself And keep fucking everybody else
Nightclub cowboy, cut your masquerade Face up to your life Midnight cowboy, play your new-look role Masturbate your mind And you will find
Nothing’s really changed You’re just as messed-up if not more It’s not a fad that’s gonna help you You’re just as trapped as you were before You’re just as trapped as you were before You’re just as trapped as you were before You’re just as trapped as you were before Another chance to waste your time Another chance to waste your time Another chance to waste your time
Mobile Electric Chair
I finally heard of a job for me A useful job that serves the community Guaranteed fun without a care To drive the Mobile Electric Chair
That would be a real job for me To retain my formal dignity I want it now Yeah, I want it for me A good job with security I want it now Yeah, I want it for me Cheap thrills and electricity
Even if I could only strap them in I’d teach the bastards to regret their sins Well, there at the place where they commit their crimes To drag their bodies out when they’ve been fried
That would be a real job for me To retain my formal dignity Oh yeah, oh yeah baby I want it now Yeah, I want it for me A good job with security I want it now Yeah, I want it for me Cheap thrills with electricity
Then to really put fear in their ass A mobile courtroom sets up on the grass They have the trial on the day of the crime American justice to deal with slime
That would be a real job for me To retain my formal dignity I want it now Yeah, I want it for me A good job with security I want it now Yeah, I want it for me Cheap thrills and electricity I want it now
Model of Stupidity
Well, don’t ask me to give you the time of day If you were smart you’d just stay away I’ve got a pile of shit for jerks like you I like to smash heads black and blue
So grab a brain You give me a pain, you know Why don’t you grab a brain A slug’s got more brains than you
You are the model of stupidity Don’t know a thing about reality I’ve got a pile of shit for jerks like you I’d like to smash heads black and blue
So grab a brain You ain’t got much time, you know Why don’t you grab a brain You give me a pain you know
An avant-garde socialite Or just a neuraloid hypocrite You’re just a fuck-up by another name A parasite in a human’s brain
So grab a brain You give me a pain, you know Why don’t you grab a brain You ain’t got much time, you know
Moron Majority
A coldness spreads across the nation People claim that it’s what they want Cause then at least they can say they made it That they were on the side that won As we go wallowing in apathy
The stench spreads across the nation But people plug their noses well And claim that their distractions are all real An ostrich mind in the structured cell
As we go wallowing in apathy, yeah we’re wallowing in apathy Now we’re ruled by the moral moron majority With their closed, backward minds Spouting all their sacred brainwashed lies We got the, the bigots push for world destruction Run and smash, we can change today
Religious phobics twisting psalms to destruction As preaching liars attempt to twist our minds We celebrate a new aggressive transition A unity in death with the lord’s design
As we go wallowing in apathy, as we wallow in our apathy Now we’re ruled by the moral moron majority With their closed, backward minds Spouting all their sacred brainwashed lies We got the, the bigots push for world destruction Must burn and smash and we can change today Oh yeah Yeah
New Order
Old ways cannon and imperial flag, white hands so huge Now aircraft carrier diplomats, white lands so few European guns in the villages, wealth bought with pain Now western power diminishes, never come again
It’s the boot stamping of the reckoning coming It’s the tank growling of the dread army coming
Many lands poor few lands rich, feel hunger pressure Balance is trembling it’s gonna flip, force without measure Demonstrate and educate, soon get imitation Soon the modern war machines in every nation
It’s the boot stamping of the reckoning coming It’s the tank growling of the dread army coming It’s the loud crashing of the dead order crumbling It’s the jet howling of the dread army coming
People rise from years of sleep, new oil power Old ways gone, no time left, soon be new hour But I grow older very day, count out my time If the crash don’t come till I’m out of the way, well I won’t mind
It’s the boot stamping of the reckoning coming It’s the tank growling of the dread army coming It’s the loud crashing of the dead order crumbling It’s the jet howling of the dread army coming
No Productivity
Got no time to kill, you got nothing to do Slow on productivity cause nothing is new Music is a mockery, words mean less Silence and destruction, a bloody mess
No productivity Forced negativity Constant anxiety Dead end society
Standing in an alley on a Saturday night Well if I wasn’t hammered it wouldn’t be right Waiting for the enemy to make their move Feeling like a target in an arcade booth
No productivity Forced negativity Constant anxiety Dead end society
You stagger home to bed at a quarter past two Stoned out of your head on acid and glue You can’t tell your parents what it is that you do You don’t dig the opening you’re forced to go through No productivity Forced negativity Constant anxiety Dead end society No productivity
No Wishes, No Prayers
You’ve got control of your own destiny No wishes, no prayers It’s got to be your own responsibility
No invisible guardians No wishes, no prayers You’ve got to dig your head out from the bloody sand
One by one in the street Realizing they don’t want defeat They shout defiance at the ritual sheep
A million wars in the name of some god No wishes, no prayers Superstition wastes the dawning of a better day
Missionaries teaching god to the savage mind No wishes, no prayers So now they know to hate satan and live a life of fear
One by one in the street Realizing they don’t want defeat They shout defiance at the ritual sheep
Learning to see just what’s right For some sanity they now must fight Once you’ve seen what could be, there’s no turning back There’s no turning back Once you’ve seen what could be, there’s no turning back
A new idea finally sees its time No wishes, no prayers Still attached to the blackmailers of yesterday
Now the question is a race against time No wishes, no prayers To fight the ignorance that’s in our way
One by one in the street Realizing they don’t want defeat They shout defiance at the ritual sheep
Learning to see just what’s right For some sanity they now must fight Once you’ve seen what could be, there’s no turning back
No wishes, no prayers No wishes, no prayers No wishes, no prayers No wishes, no prayers
Oh Canaduh
Every new day the dollar goes down The sea’s getting blacker, the sky’s turning brown You ain’t got a job, you can’t pay the rent And now you’re paying interest on all the money you’ve been lent
Oh Canaduh What’s wrong with you You better wake up Now what you gonna do
The big companies are milking us dry Our corporation nation is soon gonna die And in the capitol they’re sipping their tea They care about their paycheques but not about you and me
Oh Canaduh What’s wrong with you You better wake up Now what you gonna do
You spent all your money on a lot of useless toys You’re so fucking dumb you stupid cowboys You ain’t got no jobs, you can’t pay the rent And now we’re paying interest on all the money you’ve been lent
Oh Canaduh What’s wrong with you You better wake up Now what you gonna do
White wasteland
Out of Line
My parents told me to go to school My teachers told me the golden rule The rules told me just be cool I’m not going to play their fucking fool
Shut up your mouth Shut up your eyes Shut down your brain Don’t step out of line, they’ll show you’re insane
Don’t tell me what to do I don’t need you Don’t tell me what to see You’re nothing to me
Dropped out of school, forgot what they said Don’t follow rules, words that are dead On the run from the thought patrol Witht their destruction the final goal
Open your mouth Open your eyes Open your brain Step out of line, show you’re insane
Refugee
It seems like human hands are made to hurt It seems like human hearts are made of dirt They’ll hurt you every time, and you don’t know why If you can’t learn to hold on tight, learn to say goodbye
Isn’t it clear you’re not wanted here Isn’t it clear you’re not wanted here
Every time you look around, something’s going wrong The good things dry up overnight, the bad go on and on You’re not crazy, you’re seeing it right, that’s reality You never get the things you want, except in fantasy
Isn’t it clear you’re not wanted here Isn’t it clear you’re not wanted here You’ve got your orders, refugee You’ve got your orders, refugee You’ve got your orders, refugee You’ve got your orders, refugee
Isn’t it clear you’re not wanted here Isn’t it clear you’re not wanted here
Isn’t it clear you’re not wanted here Isn’t it clear you’re not wanted here
You’ve got your orders, refugee You’ve got your orders, refugee You’ve got your orders, refugee You’ve got your orders, refugee
You’ve got your orders, refugee You’re not wanted here
Slap in the Face
I want to see some getting back to reality No more punk posturing, you may as well build ICBMs No more nine to five, cause this society is in a dive And if you play the rules, you may as well just pack it in
Can’t you see what has happened to us, left on our own Waiting for rebellion coming down tomorrow, waiting to be shown
The music spoke our thoughts until it fell to the money men They bought it cheap and made us all look like fools again Another slap in the face and then the people who demanded change Were pushed aside by faddist wimps dancing to new wave
Now once again they’ve drawn the line They don’t need you anyway We better wring their bloody necks this time Oh yeah, oh yeah
I want to see some getting back to reality No more punk posturing, you may as well build ICBMs No more nine to five, cause this society is in a dive And if you play the rules, you may as well just pack it in
Can’t you see what has happened to us, left on our own Waiting for rebellion coming down tomorrow, waiting to be shown
Can’t you see what has happened to us, left on our own Waiting for rebellion coming down tomorrow, waiting to be shown Not by you
Slave to My Dick
I put on my clothes that make me look tall I don’t think about it, cause I don’t think at all I dress high class, makes me look high paid You know I do it baby cause I wanta get laid I’m just a slave to my dick It really makes me sick
I lie to myself and to my friends too And if I want your girl I’ll lie to you too I’ll play stupid games, do whatever it takes Cause I’ve gotta have a ball and the time’s getting late I’m just a slave to my dick It really makes me sick
I live in the bars, I live in the pubs My mind is a blank from drinking in the clubs I do a lot of talking but I don’t say much I can’t be real cause I’m such, you know I’m such a Slave to my dick It really makes me sick
Slave to my dick Slave to my dick Slave to my dick Slave to my dick
The Scheme
They said that we can’t Play for the big man We were too outspoken They think that they can choke us out Rip off the punks The big promoters rake the grands One hundred and fifty bucks Is all the assholes pay the bands
I can’t stand the new regime Commercial rock, new wave pop Mindless music I’ve seen through the scheme I won’t suck for success What’s the point of songs about pointless trash
And they wonder why That all the punks are mad Why don’t we grow up And play their game Well if you don’t know I guess that’s cool But if you think we’re jerks Then you’re a bloody fool
I can’t stand the new regime Commercial rock, new wave pop Mindless music I’ve seen through the scheme I won’t suck for success What’s the point of songs about pointless trash
I can’t stand the new regime Commercial rock, new wave pop Mindless music I’ve seen through the scheme I won’t suck for success What’s the point of songs about pointless trash
And they wonder why That all the punks are mad Why don’t we grow up And play their game Well if you don’t know I guess that’s cool But if you think we’re jerks Then you’re a bloody fool
Urban Guerrillas
Positive emotion means negative action So cause a commotion and love the reaction Negative thoughts clear your head Eloquent logic says you’d be better off dead
Guerrillas, urban guerrillas Living in an urban zoo Guerrillas, urban guerrillas Point the way for me and you
Ridiculous charges, men on the run Explosions at midnight, the barrels of guns Roadblocks are funny, gelignite’s neat People are nothing but unslaughtered meat
Guerrillas, urban guerrillas Living in an urban zoo Guerrillas, urban guerrillas Point the way for me and you
Cryptic letters in newspaper type The mysteries of death, the power of knives Cool on the corner, hope nobody’s looking Watch over your shoulder, watch out for what’s cooking
Guerrillas, urban guerrillas Living in an urban zoo Guerrillas, urban guerrillas Point the way for me and you
War in the Head
He can’t seem to find the trouble he’s been looking for He gets police action when he wants world war He has lifeless days he can barely get through He waits and waits and waits for something new
War in the head He wants to move it outside War in the head He has to move it outside
He says that lies are crimes but he doesn’t believe it They’re just another tool to use What’s wrong with him? He can’t affect anything He shoves and pushes but nothing ever moves
War in the head He wants to move it outside War in the head He has to move it outside
Everyone he knows found a protective hole He can’t see his but he knows it’s there He says that things have to change for the better He wishes things would change anyway at all
War in the head He wants to move it outside War in the head He has to move it outside
War in the head War in the head War in the head War in the head War in the head War in the head

We’re Alive
Again we’re in the news, again it’s all a lie They wish we’d go away, they wish that we would die You never know the reason cause you only saw the fad You never heard us play but you’re sure we’re really bad
You ain’t worth shit but I’m still going to warn you We’re alive Better keep an eye over your shoulder We’re alive
They say it ain’t conspiracy but I don’t know See money calls the shots, so money’s got to go Musical monopoly is really a drag You think you picked the stars so the rest you’re gonna slag
You ain’t worth shit but I’m still going to warn you We’re alive Better keep an eye over your shoulder We’re alive
You think up here in Lotus Land we’re really having fun I’m waiting for my welfare but it may never come Well just remember when you jerk yourself in bed Our job will never be done till every dog is dead
We’re alive Better keep an eye over your shoulder We’re alive We’re alive We’re alive We’re alive
