 Stupid Songs 
When I sing songs I sing about what I know But I don't know too much so I don't sing about nothing I get my words from reading TV Guide I steal all my solos from the Rolling Stones  I like stupid songs  I get my insight from watching Spiderman I learned a lot from Peter Parker about dealing with the world I pull my wire to the 20 Minute Workout I sure wish the guys in the band looked like that  I like stupid songs

 Argh Fuck Kill 
Bla bla bla bla Bla bla bla bla, etc. Argh...Fuck...Kill

 Die Sinner Die 
You have sinned so you must die Die sinner die You will bring on the red tide Die sinner die Jerry Falwell's god says that war is good At least that's what they tell us and christians never lie  You will hang in the park Die sinner die God's army will leave its mark Die sinner die We'll burn the fire of communism by lighting you on fire And then we'll roast jelly beans on the funeral pyre

 Bedtime Story 
Flesh and blood and splattered guts Dripping brains and radiation Everybody's mutilated Screaming missiles and burning babies  This is just a bedtime story to help you through the night Cause when you wake up tomorrow morning you're gonna have to fight

 My Girl 
Oh my girl she's a bit homely She's got a few fleas and a touch of the mange In fact she's so oh oh oh oh so god damn ugly yeah ugly, oh she’s ugly, woah ugly Oh my girl she's got a big sticky tongue Four hairy legs and a big smelly cunt Her name is oh oh oh oh her name is  Lassie yeah lassie, woah lassie lassie come home
Oh my girl like we said she’s a dog
But don’t try to put me down
Until you try her out
Oh my girl


 Dogfarts 
One day when I was home alone Just me and the dog holding the phone I gave my pal a piece of cheese It was limberger the cheese that pleezes  Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh he had to go Oo oo oo oo oo oo oo Number two Ar ar ar ar ar ar ar it was to far Or or or or or or or to the door  There was shit and piss all over the place My dog Wallace had gone to pieces There was a revolting oder in the air It was limberger the cheese that pleezes

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh he had to go ee ee ee ee ee ee ee Number three Ar ar ar ar ar ar ar it was to far Or or or or or or or to the door

Dog farts Dog farts Dog farts Dog farts Dog farts

 Inside My Head 
I don't think you understand Just where the fuck we're coming from You think that the world is bland And we're here to relieve the monotony  I don't care what you think you can't see inside my head   I tell you to pound you pud I tell you to kill your mother I tell you to rape your dog You might as well, you'll get no other

I don't care what you say you can't see inside my brain
I don't care what you think you can't see inside my head
I don't care what you say you can't see inside my brain

 Proud To Be Canadian 
I'm proud to be a Canadian Pass me another beer I'm proud to be a Canadian Hold my seat while i take a piss  Our prime minister sucks dogshit through his nose His ex-wife gets brown showers from Mick Jagger The only reason we live in fucking igloos Is our government makes a living licking shit holes  I'm proud to be a Canadian Pass me another welfare check I'm proud to be a Canadian Hold my seat while i go out and cash it  I'm proud to be a Canadian Pass me another eskimo I'm proud to be a Canadian Hold my seat while i fuck her up the ass hole

 Stupid World 
Lisa washed her hair on Monday Lisa washed her hair on Tuesday Lisa washed her hair on Wednesday Lisa washed her hair in Thursday  Then her husband noticed that her shampoo Had upset her pH balance Her hair was all dried out and frizzy So he shot the bitch and moved to the city

Oh what a stupid world  Her husband got a job at a roller rink He tried to pick up chicks but he had a little dink He brushed his teeth with Aim but it didn't matter Nice fresh breath but his dink didn't get no bigger  Oh what a stupid world
Oh what a stupid world

 Fuck My Shit Stinks 
Sittin on the pot on Tuesday morning Reading about the war in Lebanon A car bomb killed three yankees in Rome But I got a bigger problem and its closer to home  Oh fuck my shit stinks Holy fucking moly my shit stinks Argh fuck billy my shit stinks  Maybe there's something wrong with my diet I had a case of beer and couple of tacos You know I feel like Johnny Cash Going down in that ring of burning fire

Oh fuck my shit stinks Holy fucking moly my shit stinks Argh fuck billy my shit stinks  Well all my friends like heavy metal But I've always been partial to polkas While they're all playin their air guitars I'm fartin along with the booming tubas

Oh fuck my shit stinks Holy fucking moly my shit stinks Argh fuck billy my shit stinks

 Fuck Satan To Death 
Jesus is my savior and satan must die This is the end ready for death Reaper is near pity the damned Lucifer's lust has got out of hand Let's fuck him up by fucking his ass Rear out his tail pull out his horns Send the fucker where he belongs Send the mother back to his hole Let's take him out and slip him the pole It's easier said than easier done The battle's over and we have won Snuff out his life and have the last laugh 'Cause we've got jesus here in the band


 Dragons 
You created your character But your destiny is ruled by the die of six You're standing at the edge of churning black water A tributary of the river Styx I am the master of this world I could have the earth devour you where you stand You exist for my pleasure You'll soon wish you never stepped into my dungeon Clutching hands grab at your legs They pull you down underground You draw your sword, recoil in horror The serpent's venom takes its toll I am the master of this world I'll have my fun with you One by one your lives are coming to an end
Look around at all the world

I am the master of this world
I could have the earth devour you where you stand You exist for my pleasure You'll soon wish you never stepped into my dungeon
 You're the last alive and you've lost your nerve You turn and run you might survive You need a way to leave this plain You'll lose your soul if you remain You see a door no time to lose Kick it down and run right through You step into a glowing cavern Suddenly you hear a voice I am the master of this world You're all fools if you think you can escape You're in this 'til the end Look around see what you have to fight Dragons


 Hide The Hamster 
Well Billy was a boy who has a few ideas of his own He has a habitrail maze with 35 hamsters in his home He takes them to the disco where everybody loves him They cover them with neet and wash them down so they are nice and clean Then yank their teeth and pull their claws and dip the little rodents in vaseline They all have habitrail tubes stuck firmly up their asses  And they all sing oho oho hide the hamster
oho oho hide the hamster  They dance around on the dance floor From each shaking ass hangs a twitching little tail The hamsters last about five minutes And their death throws bring the dancers close to ecstasy They shoot their wads together dead hamsters up their asses  And they all sing hide the hide the hide the hamster
hide the hide the hide the hamster  They all have habitrail tubes stuck firmly up their asses Each hamster has an orgasm at the very instant of its death So each person grabs a straw to feltch their partner's asshole of the sperm They'll suck their straws together and swallow rodent semen  And they all sing hide the hide the hide the hamster
hide the hide the hide the hamster
hide the hide the hide the hamster

 Drugged And Driving 
It was a quarter to twelve and we were rocking I put my money on the bar, I heard the devil knocking We played some drinking games while the band was thrashing And a fight broke out so we gave the place a trashing When the cops showed up I had to eat all my drugs A couple of the guys got the kiss their billy clubs The rest of us got out through the basement door I ran to the back and i dove into my car  I was drugged Drugged and driving
I was drugged Drugged and driving  We got away clean but I was feeling kind of strange I just ate 25 speeders I could feel the adrenaline pumping through my veins like a burning fire straight to my brain and then to the tires of the car I was driving at sixty miles an hour I stepped on the gas and went with the power screaming like an angel of the devil my friends are in the back and we're headed straight for hell 
We were drugged
Drugged and driving
We were drugged
Drugged and driving
 if you're on our roads you better keep on your toes 'cause we're gonna get you into our sights we're gonna track you down 'cause we're the demons of the underground caverns of lucifer and when we get you under our hooves we'll trample you into the dirt and tear your soul from your broken carcass and deliver it unto our lord

It was a quarter to twelve and we were rocking I put my money on the bar, I heard the devil knocking We played some drinking games while the band was thrashing And a fight broke out so we gave the place a trashing When the cops showed up I had to eat all my drugs A couple of the guys got the kiss their billy clubs The rest of us got out through the basement door I ran to the back and i dove into my car

I was drugged Drugged and driving
I was drugged Drugged and driving
We were drugged
Drugged and driving

 Here Today, Guano Tomorrow 
Bill and Tammy Bakker were messengers of God and the Bank of America Tammy sprays on her makeup, pops some downers and says this must be heaven Jim is in the bedroom converting hookers on a mattress full of money Meanwhile another 1000 people make their beds with death and misery and starvation  They were here Here for today But they'll be guano Guano tomorrow  Now it's Reverend Fallwell's church and he has the need for a little more money It will cost a lot to eliminate rock and stamp out the international threat of communism Mister Reagan and Gorbachev will let us fight like animals in a barnyard While they play the roles of the farmer the butcher, the distributor, and the consumer

They were here Here for today But they'll be guano Guano tomorrow
They were here Here for today But they'll be guano Guano tomorrow

They were here Here for today But they'll be guano Guano tomorrow
They were here Here for today But they'll be guano Guano tomorrow  The world is full of humanitarians killing each other for a piece of the human pie Where everybody is right and nobody is wrong and many are downtrodden These people call me a cretin 'cause i get a little spittle in their eye And they don't care much for us Dayglos sitting around and toasting to the end of time  We are here Here for today But we'll be guano Guano tomorrow
We are here Here for today But we'll be guano Guano tomorrow
We are here Here for today But we'll be guano Guano tomorrow
We are here Here for today But we'll be guano Guano tomorrow

1967
It doesn't matter I've got a library I've got a swimming pool I drive the Lamborghini Dad drives the Cadillac Mom's got an MG I don't have a job I don't go to school I just sit at home I don't have to worry They got lots of money They won't let me starve In 1967 things weren't this good My daddy was a hippie Now he's a head of state I don't have no peers I don't know no queers It doesn't bother me I don't get in fights When I go out at night Coz my chauffeur is a killer I don't have to look When i want a fuck I just spend some money I get more allowance Than you fucking middle Class bums will ever see
In 1967 things weren't this good My daddy was a hippie Now he's a head of state in 1967
In 1967
In 1967

Scared of people

I'm scared of people really don't know why I nearly shit my pants when they look me in the eye I'm scared of people and I'm scared of you I'm gonna go inside and shoot some glue 
I'm insecure and paranoid I'm gonna get killed and I don't know when All this stress and all this strain Is too much for my little brain I’m scared of people and I wanna die
I’m gonna go inside commit suicide
I’m scared of people and I’m scared of you
Wanna be dead before the day is through

Black sabbath

Acting like black sabbath is lots of fun Their records sound so heavy when I turn them on I jump up and down and pretend I'm them I can almost make the change 
Acting like black sabbath
Acting like black sabbath
Acting like black sabbath
 Tony iommi is my god His guitar solos have been ostracized  Ozzy Osbourne is so out in space That he'd probably love me if I pissed on his face

Acting like black sabbath
Acting like black sabbath
Acting like black sabbath
No no no



Used to be in love

I used to be in love with the world Until I listened to the leaders words I used to hang around with the guys When they told me to split I fucking near died  I used to be in love I used to be in love

I used to go to the horror shows Now I don't bother cause I'm one myself When I go out the people stare Cause I look like a psychopathic killer  I used to be in love I used to be in love
I used to be in love I used to be in love

I used to be in love with the world Until I listened to the leaders words I used to hang around with the guys When they told me to split I fucking near died  I used to be in love I used to be in love



I killed mommy
I couldn't stand their attitude for another day They were trying to synchronize me so I blew them away My daddy was a bitch he screwed around with my dog and cat My mommy satisfied her thirst with a bag of urine  I kinda liked my sisters friends Keep em fresh in the fridge Murdered the bitch with a baseball bat She was only five wadda ya think of that  I knocked her down the basement stairs Then I burned off all her hair Mutilated her virgin body My mommy caught me and she tried to stop me  I killed mommy with my automatic
I killed mommy with my automatic

Suicide

It used to be a dirty word Something I would never say But now when I take a look at the world There couldn't be a better way  I killed my mother when I was ten I fucked my sister with vaseline Hung my daddy with a telephone wire Now there's nobody left so I may as well fire

The idiot

I'm an idiot and I don't care It doesn't bother me when the people stare My mind is blank I don't get confuzed Cause I can't think with a blown fuse  I'm an idiot and I don't give a shit a shit a shit a shit  I can't read or write or tie my shoes The government pays for my food and my clothes I live in a big apartment building Low income family dwellings
