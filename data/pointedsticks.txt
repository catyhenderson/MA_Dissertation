what do you want me to do
You walked out took your chance
You turned your back on our romance
You said you'd found somebody new
You said the change would do you good

But then the bubble burst your dream
Turned into a nightmare scream
He pushed you till you nearly cracked
But now you say you want me back

But baby, baby, what do you want me to do (what do you want me to do)
Say that I need you more (need you more)
Is that what real lovers do (is that what real lovers do)
Or only what you use me for (use me for)

You never even gave me a thought
You figured that I'd be alright
I never had a chance to persuade you
You never let me put up a fight

You wanted that boy so bad
Until you found out that you'd been had
You came crawling to me on your knees
Asking me to love you please

But baby, baby, what do you want me to do (what do you want me to do)
Say that I need you more (need you more)
Is that what real lovers do (is that what real lovers do)
Or only what you use me for (use me for)

But baby, baby, what do you want me to do (what do you want me to do)
Say that I need you more (need you more)
Is that what real lovers do (is that what real lovers do)
Or only what you use me for (use me for)

So what do you want me to do (what do you want me to do)
What do you want me to do (what do you want me to do)
What do you want me to do (what do you want me to do)
What do you want me to do (what do you want me to do)
Oh what do you want me to do (what do you want me to do)
Oh what do you want me to do, baby (what do you want me to do)
What do you want me to do (what do you want me to do)
What do you want me to do, baby (what do you want me to do)
What do you want me to do (what do you want me to do)
What do you want me to do (what do you want me to do)
What do you want me to do (what do you want me to do)
What do you want me to do (what do you want me to do)

somebody's mom
Please don't look at me
I've seen all that I want to see
You take your cigarettes and light them
Forty year old household item
You've got housewifeitis
With a terminal solution
Your face is like a preview of
September's Television

And you're somebody's Mom (Mom)
Even if you're just a lazy useless bum
And you married somebody's dad (Dad)
If I had been your children I sure would have been mad

And now you say your husband's queer
Running with the secretary
While you stay home and cure your ills
With sedatives and other pills

And you're somebody's Mom (Mom)
Even if you're just a lazy useless bum
And you married somebody's dad (Dad)
If I had been your children I sure would have been mad

And you're somebody's Mom (Mom)
Even if you're just a lazy useless bum
And you married somebody's dad (Dad)
If I had been your children I sure would have been mad

And you're somebody's, you're somebody's (Mom)
You're somebody's, you're somebody's (Mom)
You're somebody's, you're somebody's (Mom)
You're somebody's, you're somebody's, you're somebody's (Mom)

out of luck
I never ever wanted to get too close to you
I didn't wanna fall in love
They'd tell me all the stories of the boys and their glory
Nearly died when you gave them the shove
But I fell for you honey, now I'm feeling funny
Like maybe I'm the next in line
I guess I'm just another guy out of luck, whoa-whoa
I guess this time I've just run out of luck

Because you always told me that when we were together
You were happy for the very first time,
I'd look into your blue eyes and figured that you meant it
And that everybody else was lying

But now you come and tell me that you really like me
And you hope that we can still be friends,
I guess I'm just another guy out of luck, whoa-whoa
I guess this time I've just run out of luck

Now I know, you never really loved me anyway
But who cares, I learned from you just the same
And it's true, you cheapened yourself to better me
Cause I'm sure, I'll never fall for your kind again

Now I know, you never really loved me anyway
But who cares, I learned from you just the same
And it's true, you cheapened yourself to better me
Cause I'm sure, I'll never fall for your kind again

I never ever wanted to get too close to you
I didn't wanna fall in love
They'd tell me all the stories of the boys and their glory
Nearly died when you gave them the shove

But I fell for you honey, now I'm feeling funny
Like maybe I'm the next in line
I guess I'm just another guy out of luck, whoa-whoa
I guess I'm just another guy out of luck, whoa-whoa
I guess I'm just another guy out of luck, whoa-whoa
I guess this time I've just run out of luck

marching song
Like Germany in '43 everyone was down on me
And things were closing in
My ideals, all my dreams, breaking out at the seams
Without discipline
No one wanted to believe me
I was up against a wall
When she came marching in to save me
Like a guardian general
She had it worked out to an art
And now she's in command of my heart

Leather boots, thin black tie, monocle in one eye
She's so military
Well I was broken, I was dirty, but she promised not to hurt me
Such humanity
No one ever understood me
I had visions, I had plans
She mapped out the way it could be
Offered me her stiff right hand
She had it worked out to an art
And now she's in command of my heart

She gives the orders, she's got taste, she puts everything in place
With such authority
She tells me why, she shows me how, there's not a thing to stop me now
I've got validity
All the times I've had to bow out
All the chances that I've missed
But I've got re-enforcements now
It is useless to resist
She had it worked out to an art
And now she's in command of my heart
She had it worked out to an art
And now she's in command of my heart
She's in command of my heart
Yeah she's in command of my heart

perfect youth
Here comes the latest crowd
They're the kids with common view
They always look so they make you feel so old
Emotions running out of control
They have to act on intuition
And live fast for just one night and forget about tomorrow

And I think that's perfect (perfect youth)
It only happens when you're young (perfect youth)
And if you're perfect (perfect youth)
There isn't any right or wrong (perfect youth)

I used to be just like them
It's the air of confidence
Of course the styles have changed since my day about two weeks ago
But no, I don't feel bitter
This is what must happen
I lived with the realization
While they fulfill their obligations

And I think that's perfect (perfect youth)
It only happens when you're young (perfect youth)
And if you're perfect (perfect youth)
There isn't any right or wrong (perfect youth)

So face front you young Canadians
This time is yours to spend they way you choose
You just can't lose
So don't worry

And I think that's perfect (perfect youth)
It only happens when you're young (perfect youth)
And if you're perfect (perfect youth)
There isn't any right or wrong (perfect youth)

Yeah I think that's perfect (perfect youth)
It only happens when you're young (perfect youth)
And if you're perfect (perfect youth)
There isn't any right or wrong (perfect youth)

So perfect (perfect youth)
So perfect (perfect youth)
So perfect (perfect youth)
You think you're so perfect (perfect youth)
So perfect (perfect youth)
So perfect (perfect youth)
So perfect (perfect youth)
So perfect (perfect youth)
So perfect (perfect youth)
You think you're so perfect (perfect youth)
You think you're so perfect (perfect youth)
You're so so so perfect (perfect youth)
You think you're so perfect (perfect youth)

when she's alone
Her Mom and Dad didn't understand her
She didn't want to do what they planned for her to do
She came to write, to be like the other kids
Who do what they did until late at night

See the girl always laughing
When she's alone she cries
You'll see her smile and you'll feel the pressure of running
Running all the time

She didn't like the boredom of the classroom
All the things they taught her made no sense to her
Why stay inside when so much called her
Made her dream of being far away

See the girl always laughing
When she's alone she cries
You'll see her smile and you'll feel the pressure of running
Running all the time, all the time

You and beauty can't just stop the sin
From being a tragedy
And when you look a little closer you'll see what I mean
You'll see what I mean

Her Mom and Dad didn't even know her
Why do they expect to see her one more time
She made a point and everyone has felt it
Why did she have to, why did she do it at all

See the girl always laughing
When she's alone she cries
You'll see her smile and you'll feel the pressure of
You'll see her smile and you'll feel the pressure of
Running all the time, running all the time
Running all the time, running all the time

american song
Well I was in a place once
Where if you wanted something then you took it for yourself
Cause that was the way of doing things to keep the balance perfect
But I, I never did it

And I, I want what you got
And I don't ever want to share
'Cause it's capital and if you're poor, you've got yourself to blame
In such a righteous country

Just play an American song
Just play an American song

I'm never wrong
And I don't ever want to change
You know that I just want to live by standards high beyond my means
Of course, I won't admit it

Just play an American song
Just play an American song
Just play an American song
Just play an American song

I defend my family honor
And I'm not ashamed to tell you
That I don't care what happens to the rest of all the world
No I, I just pretend to

Just play an American song
Just play an American song
Just play an American song
Just play an American song
Just play an American song
Just play an American song
Just play an American song
Just play an American song
Just play an American song
Just play an American song
Just play an American song
Just play an American song

true love
If you hadn't have left me alone
I wouldn't be in such a state
If you'd stuck around just a bit
I'm sure you'd have seen things my way
All I have is your photograph at home
And you're miles and miles away
If I ever met up with you I'm sure
We'd be different as night and day

You think what's troubling me is just sentimentality, but you're wrong
I've never felt this way before about anybody else I've ever known before
And this true love is breaking my heart
Yeah, it's true, love is breaking my heart

How can I picture you now when you
Have been gone for such a long time
I must look silly to you now but still
I try and I try and I try

You think what's troubling me is just sentimentality, but you're wrong
I've never felt this way before about anyone else I've known before
And this true love is breaking my heart
Yeah, it's true, love is breaking my heart

You think what's troubling me is just sentimentality, but you're wrong
I've never felt this way before about anyone else I've known before
And this true love is breaking my heart
Yeah, it's true, love is breaking my heart
Yeah, it's true, love is breaking my heart
  

part of the noise
I've been up all night waiting for you to come home
It gets on my nerves and I don't know why you haven't phoned me
It's nearly four A. M.

Part of the noise, it's driving me crazy
The dark beats time with the rock n' roll tap
Your voice is music for me
But these noises are so frustrating

I just wanna go to sleep
I don't wanna worry about you and all of your problems
But I'm sorry
It's all just part of the noise to me, it's all just part of the noise to me

When I need a radiator dripping the tap
Baby, your sounding just like that

I've been up all night waiting for you to come home
It gets on my nerves and I don't know why you haven't phoned me
It's nearly four A. M.

Part of the noise, it's driving me crazy
The dark beats time with the rock n' roll tap
Your voice is music to me

But these noises are so frustrating
I just wanna go to sleep
I don't wanna worry about you and all of your problems
But I'm sorry
I just wanna go to sleep
I don't wanna worry about you and all of your problems
But I'm sorry
It's all just part of the noise to me, it's all just part of the noise to me
It's all just part of the noise to me, it's all just part of the noise to me
It's all just part of the noise to me, it's all just part of the noise to me
It's all just part of the noise to me, it's all just part of the noise to me
It's all just part of the noise to me, it's all just part of the noise to me
It's all just part of the noise to me, it's all just part of the noise to me
It's all just part of the noise to me, it's all just part of the noise to me
It's all just part of the noise to me, it's all just part of the noise to me

lies
Lies, all the things you told me
No base in truth, blatant fiction tales
Lies, obvious evasion
You're speaking words that don't mean a thing
When we are in the same room
You talk like I'm a fool
You think that I believe everything
When really, I don't believe anything
It's all lies, speaking in distortion
Well I have eyes and I'll see the truth
Lies, what you did to me
You're covering up what you want to hide
When I look into your face
I see the lips that lies have had

You think that I believe everything
When really, I don't believe anything
Lies, all the things you told me
No base in truth, blatant fiction tales
Lies, obvious evasion
You're speaking words that don't mean a thing
When we are in the same room
You talk like I'm a fool
You think that I believe everything
You think that I believe everything
You think that I believe everything
When really, I don't believe anything
It's all lies (lies)

i'm numb
I thought you really loved me
That's what you said and it surprised me when I found out that it wasn't so
Well I'm just another number
It wasn't worth a dime to call me and tell me, let me in on the news

You walked out (I feel numb)
You walked out (I looked dumb)
You walked out so don't come back no more

I talked to love eternal
And then I turned my back to find you burned me, burned me, traded me for someone new
I couldn't get too angry, I only felt frustration
I'm allergic to an unconditioned response

You walked out (I feel numb)
You walked out (I looked dumb)
You walked out so don't come back no more

I felt your feelings start to please me
And I felt your arms begin to squeeze me
You told me you'd never release me
I guess you made that up to freeze me

You walked out (I feel numb)
You walked out (I looked dumb)
You walked out so don't come back no more

You walked out (I feel numb)
You walked out (I looked dumb)
You walked out so don't come back no more

the witch
See you got a little girl
She's new in town
Well you better watch out now
'Cause she'll put you down
She's an evil chick
Said she's the witch
She's got long black hair
Big black car
I know what you're thinking
But you won't get far
She's gonna make you itch
Said she's the witch
When she walks around late at night
Most of the people are sleeping tight
If you hear knocking on your door
You better send them away (*howl*)
And now you know the score
I've made it clear
And do you remember
I told you so
She's gonna make you itch
Said she's the witch
When she walks around late at night
Most of the people are sleeping tight
If you hear knocking on your door
You better send them away (*howl*)
Got a little girl
She's new in town
Well you better watch out now
She might put you down now
She's gonna make you itch
Said she's the witch

Well I met a girl
She looked the way you do
She looked the way you do
Yeah, looked the way you do
And I met a girl

Yeah, dressed the way you do, the way you do
And I saw her walk
She walked the way you do
She walked the way you do
Yeah, walked the way you do
And I heard her talk
She talked the way you do
Yeah, talked the way you do
She talked the way you do, the way you do
But it's not

Oh no, it's not
Oh no, it's not
No, it's not really you at all
Well I kissed that girl
She kissed the way you
She kissed the way you do
Yeah, kissed the way you do
And I had this though
That she was really you
That she was really you
That she was really you
But it's not
Oh no, it's not
