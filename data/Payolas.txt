"China Boys"

Ten billion people living in one room
I hear them singing a simple tune
I hear them calling
I'm after you
I want your trousers
I want your shoes
Roll out red carpets
Here come the china boys
Roll out red carpets
Here come the china boys

Ten billion people knocking on your door
I want to stay here
Sleep on the floor
I hear them laughing
I know where you are
I don't want your TV
I want your car
Roll out red carpets
Here come the china boys
Roll out red carpets
Here come the china boys

Ten billion people across the sea
Ten billion people like you and me
I see them smiling
They think it's fun
They've got some rowboats
They've got some guns
Roll out red carpets
Where are the china boys
Roll out red carpets
Here come the china boys

hastings street
said i'm living down hastings street
got the whole world at my feet
i did my best and i tried not to quit
hiding away in my sketchy bedsit
and i didn't know my heroes
looks like my future's a mess
there are people who are starving all over this place
lines on the forehead and down my face 
and i didn't want to grow up this fast
i thought my fun would last
there's nothing left to shout about
nothing worth dying for
there's no one here, just me and my problems
even my dreams of escaping
well now there's no room at the top
see i've grown unfriendly and i trust no one
lord i wish i could turn the picture back
see i'm living in the scene from a cop show
and even the good guys are bad
proud men you used to have to buy them
now you're got to dry them
i didn't want to grow up this fast
i thought my fun would last
there's nothing left to shout about
nothing worth dying for
there's no one here, just me and my problems
scream like a knife cutting silence
god i have? at the dark
things didn't turn out the way that i planned
losing my life in this old man's land
living down hastings street
the world at my feet 
i did my best and i tried not to quit
hiding away in my sketchy bedsit
i didn't want to grow up this fast
i thought my fun would last
there's nothing left to shout about
nothing worth dying for
there's no one here, just me and my problems
there's nothing left to shout about
nothing worth dying for
there's no one here, just me and my problems

"Eyes Of A Stranger"

Can I touch you to see if you're real?
Is it nothing the something I feel?
Will my heart take the strain,
Or will it break down again?

In your lips I sense a danger
You've got the eyes of a stranger

Have I been sleeping for all these years?
Is it magic that makes you appear?
When you walked in the room
I felt my heart race
But I knew I'd been fooled
When I looked at your face

In your lips I sense a danger
You've got the eyes of a stranger
In your lips I see a danger
You've got the eyes of a stranger

In your lips I sense a danger
You've got the eyes of a stranger
In your lips I see a danger
You've got the eyes of a stranger
You've got the eyes of a stranger
You've got the eyes of a stranger
You've got the eyes of a stranger
You've got the eyes of a stranger
