automan
Don’t wanna be left out Thinking’ for myself I wanna be part of it all My brain on the shelf I wanna have a job Work for someone else
I will be your automan
Don’t wanna be left out I wanna be normal I wanna wear the same clothes As everybody else No more second hand So you can see what I am
I will be your automan I will do anything you want
Shove a quarter in the slot And you will understand I will be your automan
I wanna sell your product Whatever it may be I wanna new car Like the ones that I see I wanna eat right Bone dry and squeaky clean
I will be your automan
Don’t wanna be left out I’ll get a good rating Ten of fifteen credit cards Computerized lady A nuclear kitchen Robots at the mall
I will be your automan I will do anything you want
Shove a quarter in the slot You will understand I will be your automan
I wanna eat your product I want it wall to wall Renewable prescriptions My Doctor on call I wanna be sick I wanna relax
I will be your automan I will be your automan I will be your automan

Let’s go to fucking’ Hawaii Get drunk in the sun I wanna lay on Waikiki Get a tan on my buns   Running’ from the rain Thousands on the run Making’ like the rich Heading for the fun   Let’s go to fucking’ Tahiti Lounge on the beach Those native girls are so pretty Swaying’ to the native beats   Running’ from the rain Thousands on the run Making’ like the rich Heading for the fun   2 AM Economy Air 747 Drunk to the roof Worked all summer Saved my money So I can warm   Let’s go to fucking Miami Lounging’ on the beach I got my little Cuban refugee Cheaper than a Georgia peach   Running’ from the rain Thousands on the run Thinking’ like the rich Heading for the fun   Let’s go to fucking’ Las Vegas Blow a wad in the Sun I wanna stop for a party (??) Before I’m back under the gun   Running’ from the rain Thousands on the run Making like the rich Heading for the fun   2 AM Economy Air 747 Drunk to the roof (??) Worked all summer Saved my money So I can be warm   Let’s go to fucking’ Hawaii Let’s go to fucking’ Hawaii   Running’ from the rain Thousands on the run Making’ like the rich Heading for the fun
WELL, WELL, WELL
Well, well, well I don’t have too much to say About the people I step over On my way to work Each and every day
I watch the group up the street The great unwashed They really bug me Yeah, they really bug me
I got a job I work in a bank Near Hastings and Main Cashing cheques for the slaves
And then they walk up the street Give their money back to me The Bank of BC The Bank of BC
Well, I don’t care I’m just in training For a manager’s shift In the Central Interior
Some sticky little town With a Chinese teller (??) I think I’m gonna tell her All the things I’m gonna tell her
